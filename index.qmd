## Welcome {#welcome}

Hello! This is the lesson series for the [**Openscapes Champions program**](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/), an open data science mentorship program for science teams. This is a professional development and leadership opportunity for teams to reimagine data analysis & stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. This is a remote-by-design program since its launch in 2019.

![We think about open science like a landscape, with many paths forward. The Champions Program mentors researchers, meeting them at the trailhead to help them move from sad and lonely science to team science as they identify their common needs and start navigating the landscape together with a cohort of their peers.

This Champions Lesson Series is improved openly and iteratively, and the most recent version always available online for reuse and remix. Each chapter in our **Core Lessons** focus on building a mindset and skillset for collaborative, reproducible workflows and culture within teams, while developing sustained learning practices connected with broader communities. See the [Champions Program webpage ](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/) for programmatic details (including frequently asked questions about [what is a team](https://www.openscapes.org/faq/)) and explore [stories from 18+ previous cohorts](https://openscapes.org/events#category=champions).

## Purpose, Outcomes, Process (POP)

This is the Champions Program [POP](https://suzannehawkes.com/2010/04/09/pop-everything/), a planning tool that we learned from the open science team at Mozilla.

**Purpose:** to reimagine data analysis and stewardship through exploring open tools and practices; develop modern skills and habits that are of immediate value to you, including confidence and agency as leaders; cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities with a Future Us mindset, starting with your team.

**Outcomes:** different for everybody - this is about getting your own work done. Together we'll work on changing habits to improve your work and teamwork so you shape where you invest based on what you need. We'll develop a practice of reflecting, talking, and collaborating about data workflows with your team and community. You'll leave with a tangible Pathway (a planning document) that your team will use to help identify current practices and prioritize next steps. Your team team will share your Pathway as work-in-progress during our last Cohort Call. Champions have found the Pathway valuable to communicate their need and plans and to share with supervisors as a concrete outcome.

**Process:** through facilitated Cohort Calls, team-driven Seaside Chats & Coworking, and How We Work — which is how we describe the technical and cultural norms we practice, described in our Flywheel. Read on to learn more about these below.

## Cohort Calls

Research teams participate as a Champions Cohort with ~7 total teams over 2 months, meeting twice-monthly for five 1.5-hour sessions we call Cohort Calls. Teams focus on their own work. Each Cohort Call has two topics that introduce concepts, tooling, and examples from their peers, with time to reflect and discuss how the topics apply directly to our work. 

Cohort Calls are highly-structured and designed to be engaging, requiring discussion and active participation through scaffolded Agendas with shared live notetaking and breakout-group discussions. We begin each Cohort Call with a reminder of our [Code of Conduct](https://openscapes.org/code-of-conduct) end each lesson with bite-sized Efficiency Tips and Inclusion Tips. <!--- (Template agendas, as well as slides, tips, and other resources we use are openly available in this [Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HQHXlMVgg9lp2IYkzj8LSAG5bjyKFS6g), ready for reuse and remix).

## Seaside Chats & Coworking

Between Cohort Calls, teams have synchronous spaces via Seaside Chats and Coworking to meet, ask questions, and exchange knowledge.

Each team meets together independently for [Seaside Chats](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/03/10/seaside-chats/) - dedicated time for data/workflow discussions. This is where teams talk and screenshare to begin identifying and addressing shared needs, prompted by discussions as a cohort and using the [Pathways Concept](/core-lessons/pathways.qmd). We'll provide task suggestions but main purpose is to build the habit of talking about and strengthening shared workflows with your broader group. Seaside Chats have been described by participants as one of the most valuable parts of the Champions Program because it helps strengthen habits and culture of shared workflows and learning. 

Further, we facilitate optional Coworking sessions. Coworking comes in different flavors. For Champions Cohorts, coworking involves doing our own work at the same time together with opportunities to check in, and sometimes screenshare to get feedback or solve a problem. Seeing how other people work is a big part of this transition to working more openly and collaboratively. Some teams join Coworking together, meeting for their Seaside Chat in a breakout room with the option of talking to others in the Cohort.

## How We Work

"How We Work" refers to the technical and cultural norms we will establish during the Champions Cohort, which we developed through our [Openscapes Flywheel](https://openscapes.org/approach#openscapes-flywheel). These approaches have become some of the most valuable things teams take with them through the Champions Program, and we love hearing how folks are taking these practices to new places as they grow as leaders.

### Welcome

We are intentional to create a welcoming environment, through art, design, and clear norms. You are all welcome here. We are creating a positive learning space where everyone is welcome to ask questions and participate. We'll start off each call with a reminder of our [Code of Conduct](https://www.openscapes.org/code-of-conduct/).

### Space & Place

Together we will be creating space and place to learn, collaborate, and create shared workflows so that we aren't all responsible for this alone. 

Our Cohort will have a single **shared folder** (via Google Drive/ Microsoft Teams) that we will share ahead of time and will be linked from the calendar invite. This will have all resources specific to our Cohort. Each Cohort Call will have a highly-structured **Agenda document** so you know what is planned — and so you can more easily catch up if your internet drops out. We use headers so that you can navigate via the Table of Contents view. Further, these agendas are for live-note taking throughout the Cohort Call. It is our shared responsibility to contribute & record; this is the main place for nonverbal contribution, side conversations, and to reinforce ideas. 
    
During Cohort Calls, we encourage videos on (“faces on”) – but it is okay if this is not possible for any reason. We ask you to mute liberally/quickly – but please unmute to speak up at any point. You'll interact in small groups via breakout groups – this will help you reflect on your work and get to know each other. 

We have a **flipped approach to screensharing**. We do not screenshare slides, and instead provide links to slides and teachers indicate when everyone should advance to the next slide. This way, everyone is able to 
screenshare to show tips, how we work, and troubleshoot, not to advance slides.

- no slides
- yes troubleshoot

We start and end on time. 

### Learning & Trust

We know there is a range of technical experience – by design! We are all here because we want to improve our work around data-intensive science, get a sense of new software and approaches, reduce friction when collaborating with others, promote inclusion, and develop leadership skills. We’re all imperfect and learning together – Openscapes team included. 
We’re all accountable to each other. 

### Work Openly

TODO 
- sharing ideas, code, 
- facilitation agendas cross out timing

### Common Workflows

- Reuse agendas, coworking idea
- "fork" ideas

### Inspire

- Share what works



## Preparing for your Cohort

TODO:: Supercharge your research: self-paced learning

All Champions Program resources are designed to also be a self-paced learning resource for teams. Additionally see [Supercharge your research: a ten-week plan for open data science](https://openscapes.github.io/supercharge-research/) (Lowndes et al. 2019) and accompanying [spreadsheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19vAD1QE_mHPH1SV_N61iI3J0MJwyGaHZ_yPRVEzCRb8/edit#gid=0) that you can use to get organized with your team.

### This Series Book

The Series is written (and always improving) to be used as a reference, to teach, as self-paced learning, and for reuse and remix. And also, awesomely, it's created with the same tools and practices we will be talking about: R/RStudio - originally [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) and now [quarto](https://quarto.org) - and GitHub.
