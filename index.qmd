# Welcome {#welcome}

Hello! This book is the lesson series for the [**Openscapes Champions program**](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/), an open data science mentorship program for science teams. 

Openscapes Champions is a professional development and leadership opportunity for teams to reimagine data analysis & stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Cohorts are ~7 research teams (~35 total participants including team leads and members) that convene remotely to explore open data science tooling and practices together. This is a remote-by-design program since its launch in 2019.

This open curriculum is improved iteratively and the most recent version always available online for reuse and remix. It was originally developed from "Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools" [(Lowndes et al. 2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160). As we have learn and iterate with Champions Cohorts, the curriculum is iterating and growing as well. 

Each chapter in this book introduces the concepts, tooling, and examples that we discuss during our Champions Program Cohort Calls. The way lead and teach Cohort Calls is described more below.

## Cohort Agendas

Research teams participate as a cohort over several months, meeting twice-monthly for 1.5-hour sessions we call Cohort Calls. Cohort Calls are designed to be engaging, requiring discussion and active participation through shared live notetaking in Google Docs and group/breakout-group discussions. We explore open data science concepts, tooling, and examples together through slides that . 

Cohort Call agendas and slides are all openly available in a [Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HQHXlMVgg9lp2IYkzj8LSAG5bjyKFS6g). As we continue to learn and iterate from working with different research groups, you can always review the [agenda archive](https://github.com/Openscapes/series/blob/master/agenda-archive.md) for specific cohorts. Additionally, we end each lesson by learning hands-on efficiency tips, compiled here as an [Efficiency Tips Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSABwrk4RgOa2XBv0ZVmQCEYtLmT-YOm7WHL0ba0eREcJ5G-uk4abqznKEX0YabHux48uVGxxAZXeJ4/pub) and [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQqWV6qFUv6WOztKqj52gUfvVlYc5Emw6Z-YzoM5fr9uOHRDLTDC625pdKVe5PwhlRmZlklNB7Lulq4/pubhtml).

Between Cohort Calls, each team meets together for a [Seaside Chat](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/03/10/seaside-chats/) to begin identifying and addressing shared needs; Seaside Chats have been described by participants as one of the most valuable parts of the Champions Program because it helps strengthen a culture of shared workflows and learning. Additionally, we coordinate skill-building Clinics and Co-Working sessions (which differ from "Office Hours" because participants come to work and learn together) between Cohort Calls.

### Two-month

The two-month Champions program includes 5 Cohort Calls. The core lesson series focuses on building an open science mindset, building efficiency and open culture within the team, and building sustained learning practices with broader communities. At the end of the program, each team describes their trailhead and pathways forward.

## About

The Series is written (and always improving) to be used as a reference, to teach, or as self-paced learning. And also, awesomely, it's created with the same tools and practices we will be talking about: originally R and [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) and now [quarto](https://quarto.org), and GitHub.

[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) is co-directed by Julia Stewart Lowndes and Erin Robinson. It is operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)) and was incubated by a [Mozilla](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/) Fellowship awarded to Lowndes in 2018.
