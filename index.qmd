## Welcome {#welcome}

Hello! This is the lesson series for the [**Openscapes Champions program**](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/), an open data science mentorship program for science teams. We think about open science like a landscape, and we help researchers move from lonely science towards team science as they identify their common needs and start navigating the landscape together with a cohort of their peers.

In the foreground, a sad bunny and skunk are working alone on their laptops, each with a rain cloud over their heads. Nearby is a trailhead with a fox holding a 'Welcome!' sign for a variety of different critters to see. Past the trailhead are branching pathways through the Openscapes landscape. No matter the path, however, there are small groups of animals working together to find their way. Nods to data science are scattered throughout the image, including mountains made of data points and a satellite in the sky" fig-align="center" width="70%"}

This open curriculum is improved iteratively and the most recent version always available online for reuse and remix. Each chapter in the Core Lesson Series introduces the concepts, tooling, and examples that we discuss during our Champions Cohort Calls. We're also organizing additional Lessons, Community Lessons, and How do I... guides to support Champions teams that you can navigate to via the navigation bar. See the [Champions Program webpage ](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/) for programmatic details (including frequently asked questions about [what is a team](https://www.openscapes.org/faq/)) and explore the more than 18 [cohorts since 2019]((https://openscapes.org/events#category=champions)).

## Purpose, Outcomes, Process (POP)

This is the Champions Program [POP](https://suzannehawkes.com/2010/04/09/pop-everything/), a planning tool that we learned from Mozilla.

**Purpose** is to Reimagine data analysis and stewardship through exploring open tools and practices; Develop modern skills and habits that are of immediate value to you, including confidence and agency as leaders; Cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities with a Future Us mindset, starting with your team.

**Outcomes** are: Different for everybody - this is about changing habits to improve your work and teamwork so you shape where you invest based on what you need; A practice of talking and collaborating about data workflows with your team and community; A pathway you've identified with your team to help prioritize next steps that your team will share as work-in-progress on our last Cohort Call.

**Process** is: through facilitated Cohort Calls, team-driven Seaside Chats & Coworking, and tech & cultural norms via our Flywheel. 

## Cohort Calls

Research teams participate as a Champions Cohort with ~7 total teams over 2 months, meeting twice-monthly for five 1.5-hour sessions we call Cohort Calls.

Cohort Calls are highly-structured and designed to be engaging, requiring discussion and active participation through shared live notetaking in Google Docs and group/breakout-group discussions. We explore open data science concepts, tooling, and examples together through slides that accompany each chapter of this book. Core lessons focus on building an open science mindset, efficiency and sharing culture within the team, and developing sustained learning practices with broader communities. At the end of the program, each team describes their work in progress and pathways forward.

## Seaside Chats & Coworking

Between Cohort Calls, teams have synchronous (Seaside Chats and Coworking) and asyncronous (Slack) spaces to meet, ask questions, and exchange knowledge.

Each team meets together independently for [Seaside Chats](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/03/10/seaside-chats/) - dedicated time for data/workflow discussions. This is where teams talk and screenshare to begin identifying and addressing shared needs, prompted by discussions as a cohort and using the [Pathways Concept](/core-lessons/pathways.qmd). We'll provide task suggestions but main purpose is to build the habit of talking about and strengthening shared workflows with your broader group. Seaside Chats have been described by participants as one of the most valuable parts of the Champions Program because it helps strengthen habits and culture of shared workflows and learning. 

Further, we facilitate optional Coworking sessions. Coworking comes in different flavors. For Champions Cohorts, coworking involves doing our own work at the same time together with opportunities to check in, and sometimes screenshare to get feedback or solve a problem. Seeing how other people work is a big part of this transition to working more openly and collaboratively. Some teams join Coworking together, meeting for their Seaside Chat in a breakout room with the option of talking to others in the Cohort.

## Tech & Cultural Norms

Our technical and cultural norms during the Champions Cohort are aligned with our [Openscapes Flywheel](https://openscapes.org/approach#openscapes-flywheel).

### Welcome

You are all welcome here. We are creating a a positive learning space where everyone is welcome to ask questions and participate. We'll start off each call with a reminder of our [Code of Conduct](https://www.openscapes.org/code-of-conduct/).

We are all responsible for being aware of [positionality](https://indigenousinitiatives.ctlt.ubc.ca/classroom-climate/positionality-and-intersectionality/) & power dynamics - how differences in social position and power shape identities and access in society. We want to be mindful of how hierarchy can get in the way of our learning. Here, we’ll work to flatten that hierarchy.

### Space & Place

Together we will be creating space and place to learn, collaborate, and create shared workflows so that we aren't all responsible for this alone. 

Our Cohort will have a single **shared folder** (via Google Drive/ Microsoft Teams). Each Cohort Call will have a highly-structured **agenda document** so you can know what is planned — and so you can easily catch up if your internet cuts out. We use headers so that you can navigate via the Table of Contents view. Further, these agendas are for live-note taking throughout the Cohort Call. It is our shared responsibility to contribute & record; this is the main place for nonverbal contribution, side conversations, and to reinforce ideas. 
    
During Cohort Calls, we encourage videos on (“faces on”) – but it is okay if this is not possible for any reason. We ask you to mute liberally/quickly – but please unmute to speak up at any point. You'll interact in small groups via breakout groups – this will help you reflect on your work and get to know each other. 


TODO We flip screensharing. We screenshare to show tips, how we work, and troubleshoot, not to advance slides.

- no slides
- yes troubleshoot

We start and end on time. 

### Learning & Trust

We know there is a range of technical experience – by design! We are all here because we want to improve our work around data-intensive science, get a sense of new software and approaches, reduce friction when collaborating with others, promote inclusion, and develop leadership skills. We’re all imperfect and learning together – Openscapes team included. 
We’re all accountable to each other. 

### Work Openly

TODO 
- sharing ideas, code, 
- facilitation agendas cross out timing

### Common Workflows

- Reuse agendas, coworking idea
- "fork" ideas

### Inspire

- Share what works

TODO: revisit https://github.com/Openscapes/series/issues/32

Cohort Call agendas and slides are all openly available in a [Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HQHXlMVgg9lp2IYkzj8LSAG5bjyKFS6g), ready for reuse and remix. We end each lesson by learning hands-on efficiency tips ([Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSABwrk4RgOa2XBv0ZVmQCEYtLmT-YOm7WHL0ba0eREcJ5G-uk4abqznKEX0YabHux48uVGxxAZXeJ4/pub) and [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQqWV6qFUv6WOztKqj52gUfvVlYc5Emw6Z-YzoM5fr9uOHRDLTDC625pdKVe5PwhlRmZlklNB7Lulq4/pubhtml)) and inclusion tips.

## Preparing for your Cohort

TODO:: Supercharge your research: self-paced learning

All Champions Program resources are designed to also be a self-paced learning resource for teams. Additionally see [Supercharge your research: a ten-week plan for open data science](https://openscapes.github.io/supercharge-research/) (Lowndes et al. 2019) and accompanying [spreadsheet template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19vAD1QE_mHPH1SV_N61iI3J0MJwyGaHZ_yPRVEzCRb8/edit#gid=0) that you can use to get organized with your team.

See also other publications and presentations at [openscapes.org/media](https://openscapes.org/media).

## About

[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) helps researchers and those supporting research find each other and feel empowered to conduct data-intensive science. Our work builds from many others in the open movement, and we are also documenting our process to onboard folks and scale Openscapes in our [Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide).

### Openscapes Champions

Openscapes Champions is a professional development and leadership opportunity for teams to reimagine data analysis & stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Cohorts are \~7 research teams (\~35 total participants including team leads and members) that convene remotely to explore open data science tooling and practices together. This is a remote-by-design program since its launch in 2019.

Core lessons were originally developed from "Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools" [(Lowndes et al. 2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160). As we learn and iterate leading Champions Cohorts, the curriculum is iterating and growing as well.

### This Series Book

The Series is written (and always improving) to be used as a reference, to teach, as self-paced learning, and for reuse and remix. And also, awesomely, it's created with the same tools and practices we will be talking about: R/RStudio - originally [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) and now [quarto](https://quarto.org) - and GitHub.
