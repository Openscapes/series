## Welcome {#welcome}

Hello! This is the lesson series for the [**Openscapes Champions program**](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/), an open data science mentorship program for science teams. We think about open science like a landscape, and we help researchers move from lonely science towards team science as they identify their common needs and start navigating the landscape together with a cohort of their peers.

This open curriculum is improved iteratively and the most recent version always available online for reuse and remix. Each chapter in the Core Lesson Series introduces the concepts, tooling, and examples that we discuss during our Champions Program Cohort Calls. We're also organizing additional Champions Lessons, Community Lessons, and How To guides to support Champions teams that you can navigate to on the left.

### Cohort Calls

Research teams participate as a Champions Cohort over 2 months, meeting twice-monthly for five 1.5-hour sessions we call Cohort Calls. 

Cohort Calls are designed to be engaging, requiring discussion and active participation through shared live notetaking in Google Docs and group/breakout-group discussions. We explore open data science concepts, tooling, and examples together through slides that accompany each chapter of this book. Core lessons focus on building an open science mindset, efficiency and sharing culture within the team, and developing sustained learning practices with broader communities. At the end of the program, each team describes their work in progress and pathways forward.

Cohort Call Topics          | Series Chapters |      Seaside Chat Topics
------------------|----------------------|---------------------------
1. Openscapes mindset, better science in less time | [mindset](mindset.qmd), [better science in less time](better-science.qmd) | Pathway - where are you now
2. GitHub Clinic: publishing & project management | [publishing](github-pub.qmd), [project management](github-issues.qmd) | Shared organizing with GitHub
3. Team culture and data strategies for future us | [team culture](team-culture.qmd), [data strategies](data-strategies.qmd) | Onboarding docs, code of conduct
4. Open communities and coding strategies for future us | [open communities](communities.qmd), [coding strategies](coding-strategies.qmd) | Pathway - next steps
5. Pathways share and next steps |  | 

Between Cohort Calls, each team meets together for [Seaside Chats](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/03/10/seaside-chats/) - dedicated time for data/workflow discussions. This is where teams begin identifying and addressing shared needs, prompted by discussions as a cohort and using the [Pathways Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X_-qPdWDCpw2F3nZr6vZnq87guyUIGLvekm0XV2H-A8/edit?usp=sharing). Seaside Chats have been described by participants as one of the most valuable parts of the Champions Program because it helps strengthen habits and culture of shared workflows and learning. Additionally, we support teams between Cohort Calls through Co-Working sessions and Slack.

### Cohort Agendas

Cohort Call agendas and slides are all openly available in a [Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HQHXlMVgg9lp2IYkzj8LSAG5bjyKFS6g), ready for reuse and remix. We end each lesson by learning hands-on efficiency tips ([Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSABwrk4RgOa2XBv0ZVmQCEYtLmT-YOm7WHL0ba0eREcJ5G-uk4abqznKEX0YabHux48uVGxxAZXeJ4/pub) and [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQqWV6qFUv6WOztKqj52gUfvVlYc5Emw6Z-YzoM5fr9uOHRDLTDC625pdKVe5PwhlRmZlklNB7Lulq4/pubhtml)) and inclusion tips.

## Cohorts - past and upcoming

We have led 8+ Champions Cohorts since 2019. Starting in 2021, each Cohort has an events page with links to their GitHub repository (with quick-links to their Cohort Call Agendas so teams can more easily review), blog posts and any additional resources. Explore more at [openscapes.org/cohorts](https://openscapes.org/cohorts).

## About

[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) helps researchers reimagine data analysis, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research teams. Our work builds from many others in the open movement, and we are also documenting our process to onboard folks and scale Openscapes in our [Approach Guide](https://openscapes.github.io/approach-guide).

### Openscapes Champions 

Openscapes Champions is a professional development and leadership opportunity for teams to reimagine data analysis & stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Cohorts are ~7 research teams (~35 total participants including team leads and members) that convene remotely to explore open data science tooling and practices together. This is a remote-by-design program since its launch in 2019. 

Core lessons were originally developed from "Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools" [(Lowndes et al. 2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160). As we learn and iterate leading Champions Cohorts, the curriculum is iterating and growing as well. 

### This Series Book

The Series is written (and always improving) to be used as a reference, to teach, as self-paced learning, and for reuse and remix. And also, awesomely, it's created with the same tools and practices we will be talking about: R/RStudio - originally [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) and now [quarto](https://quarto.org) - and GitHub.
