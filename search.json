Strategy on community building through modern channels\n\n“We tell big stories that matter to a community of users, and together we use those stories to amplify a message that we all care about…And once they start telling their story as part of the bigger story, it suddenly looks like a parade.”\n\nOpen source paradigm shift\n\nI’ve come to use the term “the architecture of participation” to describe the nature of systems that are designed for user contribution.\n\n\n\n\nLeverage points: places to intervene in a system: (in increasing order of effectiveness)\n\nConstants, parameters, numbers (such as subsidies, taxes, standards).\nThe sizes of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows.\nThe structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport networks, population age structures).\nThe lengths of delays, relative to the rate of system change.\nThe strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the impacts they are trying to correct against.\nThe gain around driving positive feedback loops.\nThe structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).\nThe rules of the system (such as incentives, punishments, constraints).\nThe power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.\nThe goals of the system.\nThe mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises.\nThe power to transcend paradigms.\n\n\nSo how do you change paradigms? Thomas Kuhn, who wrote the seminal book about the great paradigm shifts of science,7 has a lot to say about that. In a nutshell, you keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm, you keep coming yourself, and loudly and with assurance from the new one, you insert people with the new paradigm in places of public visibility and power. You don’t waste time with reactionaries; rather you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded.\n\n\n\n\nCautionary Tales Podcast Ep 6 – How Britain Invented, Then Ignored, Blitzkrieg.\nThis tale is about how the organizational architecture of existing entities - whether the British army, Sony, Kodak, or Xerox - cannot always support their own innovation because of the social structures they were built upon. Fascinating to think about in terms of how open science has not been embraced by scientific communities within the existing academic structure.\n\n\n\nCautionary Tales Podcast Ep 7 – Bowie, jazz, and the unplayable piano.\nThis tale is about music: how Keith Jarrett reluctantly played on a broken piano and how David Bowie and Brian Eno’s take on collaboration led to brand new sounds and ideas. I think about this for science and openness - working out of your comfort zones and mixing up how you do it and who you do it with.\n\n\n\nFunding research infrastructure\n\nthere’s also the fact that the current funding model has led to a perceived sense of scarcity, pushing open projects to compete rather than collaborate, to build new features instead of maintaining their work and deepening their level of service for their communities. An additional dimension to our work involves looking at the staffing and human infrastructure powering open technology development, maintenance, governance and stewardship. That volunteer labor and community engagement is often an invisible cost we gloss over in our estimations and recommendations, while also being a core pillar in this work.\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://larahogan.me/sponsors/",

It can also mean moving away from long for-loops and towards smaller functions that are called to repeat operations. Refactoring makes your code more portable between people and computers. It can also make it faster, if you refactor so that pipelines can be run in parallel rather than sequentially.",

Keynote “Code Smells & Feels”\nslides and video.\nAbstract:\n\n“Code smell” is an evocative term for that vague feeling of unease we get when reading certain bits of code. It’s not necessarily wrong, but neither is it obviously correct. We may be reluctant to work on such code, because past experience suggests it’s going to be fiddly and bug-prone. In contrast, there’s another type of code that just feels good to read and work on. What’s the difference? If we can be more precise about code smells and feels, we can be intentional about writing code that is easier and more pleasant to work on. I’ve been fortunate to spend the last couple years embedded in a group of developers working on the tidyverse and r-lib packages. Based on this experience, I’ll talk about specific code smells and deodorizing strategies for R.",

The goal of FP is to make it easy to express repeated actions using high-level verbs. I think that learning a little about FP is really important for data scientists, because it’s a really good fit for many problems that you’ll encounter in practice. In this talk, I’ll introduce you to the basics of functional programming in R, using the purrr package. I’ll begin by briefly dissecting the for loop that you’re already familiar with, then continue to show why functional programming provides elegant alternatives. I’ll next dive into two examples showing where FP is particularly useful in data science: when ingesting unruly datasets spread across multiple files, and producing multiple reports for different stakeholders. You’ll get the most out of this talk if you’re familiar with R, or you’ve done data science in other languages like Python.",

    "text": "GitHub for research groups\nAs you get a better hands-on sense of GitHub’s capabilities, you’ll be thinking about how to get organized and use this for your own research group.\n\nOrganizations\nHere are two examples of GitHub Organizations created as part of Openscapes Champions Cohorts where the content is now developed and maintained to support a broader range of researchers.\n\nNASA Openscapes https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes\nNMFS Openscapes for NOAA Fisheries https://github.com/nmfs-openscapes\n\nMany Champions teams create GitHub Organizations for their research group. This is a way for all the work that happens in the research group to be organized in one place, but also clearly attributed and credited by each user who contributes.\nYou can explore other Champions teams’ GitHub organizations they’ve created. They’re listed under the Cohorts in which they participated:\nNOAA NEFSC\n\nGavin Fay Lab https://github.com/thefaylab\n\n2021 NOAA NMFS Cohort\n\nNWFSC Fisheries Engineering and Acoustic Technologies (FEAT) team https://github.com/NOAA-FEAT\nNWFSC Protected Salmonids Team https://github.com/nwfsc-math-bio\nAFSC GAP Survey Data Products https://github.com/afsc-gap-products\n\nCS&S Cohort blog post; Cohort repo\n\nKenai Watershed Forum https://github.com/Kenai-Watershed-Forum\nWildCo Lab https://github.com/WildCoLab\n\nCSU-COAST Cohort blog post; Cohort repo\n\nLogan Lab https://github.com/loganlabcsumb\nEcological Oceanography Lab at CSUN https://github.com/ecoocelab-csun\nClaisse Lab @ Cal Poly Pomona https://github.com/ClaisseLab\nCoastal Ecosystems Lab https://github.com/coastal-ecosystems-lab\n\n\n\n\nShould my students create repos in our lab organization?\nWhile there are many different approaches that could make sense for your group, our starting recommendation would be that any project happening in the research group gets its own repository, and that repository is in the research group’s Organization. This is then clearly part of the research group’s work and more findable by past/current/future members. And it can be forked to other accounts at any time.\n\n\n\nIssues\nIssues and Projects are a great way to keep organized. See a few examples in the NOAA Fisheries wiki and Openscapes How We Work issues and Planning project.\n\nHow much should I write in a single Issue?\nThe “size” of each Issue is something you’ll get a feel for as you use them more, so don’t worry too much about it as you get started. The most common “size” of Issue is something you can complete, and close. This might include smaller checklists and conversations, but it is more along the lines of “change axes labels in my plot” rather than “write thesis chapter”.\nSome Issues are also used more as reference and shared resources, and might not be closed so they’re easier to discover. Depending on your workflow and norms you establish with your group, it might be best to keep those reference issues in a different repository so you don’t have lingering open issues in a repo that you like to close issues and move on.\nWhen you’re logged into GitHub, go to https://github.com/issues to see all of the Issues assigned/created/etc for your account!\n\n\n\nBranches\nBranches are a really powerful feature for software development, but aren’t necessarily the right place for new GitHub users to get started. If there are a small number of people in a single repository and you’re all first learning, we’d suggest that you start using GitHub without branches, and focus on checking in with each other as you contribute (see R for Excel Users example collaborating with GitHub from RStudio).\n\nAside: Julie Lowndes only worked in the main branch with her small group of Ocean Health Index colleagues for the first 8 years as a GitHub user; it was only when working with the NASA Openscapes Mentors community that she learned how to use branches as software developers do.\n\nBranches are powerful as your teams grow and/or as you become savvier with GitHub and code, so it is good to discuss strategies with them.\n\nShould we do everything in a dev branch?\nFull question: “Right now any collaborative code in my group has a main branch and a dev branch. All collaborators clone the dev branch and push back to the dev branch on GitHub before anything ever goes to main. Is this best practice?”\nAdvice: This system with the dev branch works so long as the dev doesn’t diverge too far from the main branch - the Ocean Health Index project (my old research team) does it that way but it’s someone’s job for a few weeks at the end of each year making sure the dev branch can merge into main.\nAnother approach is to treat each branch as very temporary: you make a branch from main, add your contribution, make a pull request, merge and delete the branch. This is what we’ve been doing with the NASA Mentors and it’s more continuous little updates rather than larger big updates, and I think it works better when working with Jupyter Notebooks, which can cause a lot of merge conflicts.",

Burnout, people leaving science.\n\n\n\nTeam efficiency\nWe must deliberately set the tone to create a positive, inclusive research group environment that fuels team efficiency.\nThis means create a team mindset, and focusing on similarities rather differences. We all work on different projects and have different research questions, but we all have to wrangle data, organize version files, have things we don’t know…let’s create a space where we can talk about all this and find common ground to tackle together so we don’t reinvent.\nThere can be an advantage to having team conventions. This can both reduce friction and reinventing the wheel. But there also needs to be room for different skills people come in with. For example, if they’re more efficient in Python, don’t want to force R. But want to create space where folks can interoperate and work together. The tech/software side helps with this, but it’s our mindsets too. We need to be open to it.",

We will also spend time helping you plan how to actually incrementally weave them into your existing workflows.\nThe point is not to overwhelm you or make you feel like it’s too late for you or that you would need to throw out and redo everything you’ve ever done in order to take the first step. No. By seeing what’s possible and how shared practices can make your own life easier, and life easier and more streamlined and fun with your lab and beyond, you’ll start experimenting with these practices and in a few years you will be working in a completely different way.\n\n\nCreate a shared culture – in your lab, on campus, and beyond\nWe’re going to go through a lot and it’s less important that you remember it all. More importantly, you’ll know what is possible, have confidence that you can do it, and have allies so you’re not alone. The main thing to take away is that there are good ways to approach your analyses; we will teach you to expect that so you can find what you need and use it! A theme throughout is that tools exist and are being developed by real, and extraordinarily nice, people to meet you where you are and help you do what you need to do. If you expect and appreciate that, you will be more efficient in doing your awesome science.\n\n\nNo skills required. We will strategize about general approaches, specific examples using R/RStudio and GitHub\nThere are no skills required to participate, and we will not be teaching hands-on how to code or set up databases. But we will be talking about how these are important and fit together in the big picture, and how to get started learning the skills you need. This is an opportunity to discuss existing tools and how to engage, meet other labs, discuss next steps, and stay accountable.\nWe’ll talk about tools and practices broadly, but also with specific examples using R and GitHub. Won’t that software eventually become outdated you say — is it worth learning them over something else? The answer is yes, software will change and become outdated; it always has. But seeing what is possible and becoming versed in embracing existing architecture and practices will set you up to make whatever transition comes, and you will make this transition with the community, not alone. Your skills will be transferrable skills as the actual software changes. Analogy: if you learn one musical instrument, you will be able to learn another one more fluidly than if you have never learned one to begin with because maybe you can read music, understand something about timing and rhythm, etc.\n\n\nEveryone is coming with different experiences & expectations\nEveryone in this workshop is coming from a different place with different experiences and expectations. But everyone will learn something new here, because there is so much innovation in the data science world. You are encouraged to ask questions and answer those of others.\n\n\nWe are all learning together\nThese tools are new to all of us, and the best ideas come from questions from anyone. If you are already familiar with some of this material, think about how your experience was learning it, and how you might teach it to others. Use these workshop materials not only as a reference in the future but also for talking points so you can communicate the importance of these tools to your communities. A big part of this Series is not only for you to learn these skills, but for you to also teach others and increase the value and practice of open data science in science as a whole.\n\n\nVulnerability: yes! Shame: no.\nShame is not allowed here. No “I’m 34 and haven’t learned GitHub, it’s too late for me” or any of that. We have never had the opportunity to learn these things, there should be no shame on your part for that. It takes a lot of time and dedicated effort to learn and employ these practices, and they should be valued and taught. That’s why you’re here now, you should be proud that you are taking the initiative and your time to do this. No shame.\nVulnerability, however, will be involved in this Series. Vulnerability is a big part of learning and trying new things — this is a safe place for everyone to learn. Vulnerability is taking stock of where you are now and help you map out where you want to be. Being vulnerable is scary. But it shouldn’t be lonely: we all have data confessions that would love to talk about and get help with, if only our scientific culture said that was OK; if only we knew how to articulate our questions and have someone to ask. This is a place to share our vulnerabilities to ignite real change. Ask questions. Whether it’s a keyboard shortcut or philosophy of data workflows, ask and let’s talk about it.\n\n\n\nEveryone is welcome here\nYou are all welcome here, please be respectful of one another. We are setting a tone of mutual respect and a space place for learning where we assume good intentions and interact with kindness and empathy. Pass it on.",

But it was not the tools alone - it was the process the team co-created and prioritized.\n\nCreate space\nThe OHI team created space for synchronous collaboration: convenings to learn and teach each other together.\nA critical first part of this was prioritizing time (which included getting buy-in, lobbying, showcasing). Then, this meant that the team could focus time on:\n\nGetting comfortable talking about data/workflows\nBuilding trust (to share imperfect work)\nRecognizing that what we invest incrementally will have large dividends in the future\n\nThe OHI team started having “Seaside Chats”: 1x/week where they discussed filenaming, code review, standard operating procedures and documentation, and much more.\n\n\nCreate place\nCreating place is critical for asynchronous collaboration. This includes GitHub Organizations, Repositories, Issues; Google Drive Folders, Docs, Spreadsheets, and Slides; Slack Organizations and Channels; JupyterHubs, etc.\nIt is a place for code, shared practices, resources, conversations. Critically, this involves making sure that everyone on the team is comfortable contributing through these channels. This means both with the technology, and the culture of the team.\n\n\nFind the common\nThrough creating space and place, teams will find the common workflows, tools, skills that they already have and need to do their work.\nFor the OHI team, we asked how to make sure everyone can participate as they need to? We introduced new software sparingly, and helped each other learn. This included initial setup as well as follow up and practice. We leveraged existing habits & resources - within and beyond our team. Open communities were a big part of this learning. Through this we were able to distinguish data preparation (tidying) as distinct from our science, and make this actionable by shifting to smaller modular code to combine for different reports/audiences.\nDocumentation was a key part of this. And, writing documentation “for nobody” is very hard, and it’s a huge task. We prioritized documentation based on Onboarding and Offboarding: for our future selves first, and then future us.\n\n\nWhat was it really like? Transition to GitHub\nChanging behavior/habits takes time, and is messy. Here is part of the story:",

    "text": "Tidy data for efficiency, reproducibility, & collaboration\nBy Lowndes & Horst 2020, posted on the Openscapes blog: an illustrated series to tell a story about tidy data.\nTidy data has been mentioned in each of the above, as a way to organize data in spreadsheets, to prepare ready-to-analyze data, and for sharing with the FAIR principles.\nSo what is tidy data?\nFirst, a preamble:\n\nRaw data may not be stored in a tidy way\n“Wrangling” data into tidy structure should be done programmatically as part of the analytical process - keep the raw data raw\nTidy data is a philosophy\nThere are existing tools to help\n\nRemember that “tidying data (”data wrangling”) – up to 50–80% of a data scientist’s time” Lohr 2014, New York Times, so it’s important to leverage these existing philosophies and tools.\nWhen we talk about organizing data to help us work in an efficient, reproducible, and collaborative way, we are talking about TIDY DATA. We mean deliberately thinking about the shape and structure of data – something that might not seem super exciting but is truly game-changing.\nSo let’s talk about what tidy data is and why it is so empowering for your analytical life.\n\nWhat is tidy data?\nTidy data is a way to describe data that’s organized with a particular structure – a rectangular structure, where each variable has its own column, and each observation has its own row (Wickham 2014).\n\n\n\n\nThis standard structure of tidy data led Hadley Wickham to describe it the way Leo Tolstoy describes families. Leo says “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way”. Similarly, Hadley says “tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy data for more efficient data science\nTidy data allows you to be more efficient by using existing tools deliberately built to do the things you need to do, from subsetting portions of your data to plotting maps of your study area. Using existing tools saves you from building from scratch each time you work with a new dataset (which can be time-consuming and demoralizing). And luckily, there are a lot of tools specifically built to wrangle untidy data into tidy data (for example, in the tidyr package). By being more equipped to wrangle your data into a tidy format, you can get to your analyses faster to start answering the questions you’re asking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy data for easier collaboration\nTidy data makes it easier to collaborate because our friends can use the same tools in a familiar way. Whether thinking about collaborators as current teammates, your future self, or future teammates, organizing and sharing data in a consistent and predictable way means less adjustment, time, and effort for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy data for reproducibility and reuse\nTidy data also makes it easier to reproduce analyses because they are easier to understand, update, and reuse. By using tools together that all expect tidy data as inputs, you can build and iterate really powerful workflows. And, when you have additional data entries, it’s no problem to re-run your code!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy data for the win!\nOnce you are empowered with tools to work with tidy data generally, it opens up a whole new world of datasets that feel more approachable because you can work using familiar tools. This transferrable confidence and ability to collaborate might be the best thing about tidy data.\n\n\n\n\nSo for more efficient, reproducible, and collaborative analyses, make friends with tidy data!",

This convention is neither new, nor unique to R.\nIt’s like agreeing that we will all drive on the left or the right. A hallmark of civilization is following conventions that constrain your behavior a little, in the name of public safety.\n\n\nRStudio Projects\nThe RStudio IDE has a notion of a (capital “P”) Project, which is a very effective implementation of (small “p”) projects.\nProject have an.Rproj file in the folder, which is used to store settings specific to that project.

I find Issues not only useful to discuss topics as a team, but I also treat it as my external memory: I write notes to myself, link to files and websites; I leave breadcrumbs for myself so that I am more easily able to remember my past thought processes and pick up projects where I left off.\nIn this way, GitHub Issues help actualize the mindset of Future You and Future Us. This means being deliberate now about communicating decisions and progress so that you or others can work in the future a little more smoothly. Using project management software is a strategy used by every software developer or people working on projects with many moving parts. It streamlines technical discussions with people who are coming/joining a group. It also helps organize and track projects that single or multiple & overlapping users can be a part of.\nWhile there are many options for project management software out there, I like using GitHub because it’s already managing my code and my work, and linked to my collaborators so it offers a streamlined way to communicate. It’s also one less account I need to have, which is a huge bonus in my mind.\nOne of the reason we talk about Issues in Openscapes is because they are an excellent way to develop habits for using GitHub for your analytical project more broadly.",

Issues is GitHub’s project management and task-tracking feature.\n\nIssues “track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.” - GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\nJenny Bryan has an excellent summary of Issues in her article “Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?” (open-access pre-print from PeerJ, published in The American Statistican):\n\nGitHub issues are another powerful feature of the platform. Recall that we are repurposing Git, a tool that facilitates software development. Think of the issues for a project as its bug tracker. For projects that are not pure software development, we co-opt this machinery to organize our to-do list more generally. The basic unit is an issue and you can interact with one in two ways.\n\n\nFirst, issues are integrated into the project’s web interface on GitHub, with a rich set of options for linking to project files and incremental changes. Second, issues and their associated comment threads appear in your email, just like regular messages (this can, of course, be configured). The result is that all correspondence about a project comes through your normal channels, but is also tracked inside the project itself, with excellent navigability and search capabilities. For software, issues are used to track bugs and feature requests. In a data analysis project, you might open an issue to flesh out a specific sub-analysis or to develop a complicated figure. In a course, we use them to manage homework submission, marking, and peer review.\n\n\nIssues can be assigned to specific people and they can be labelled, e.g. “bug”, “simulation- study”, or “final-exam”. Coupled with the ability to cross-link issues and the project files or file changes, you have extraordinary power to document why things have happened in the past and to organize what needs to happen in the future.\n\n\nYou create an Issue for a topic, and use it track progress or ask questions. You can provide links, describe updates, link to other Issues, and you can close the Issue when it is completed. You can also re-open previously-closed Issues.\nEvery GitHub repository has this Issues feature. This means that sometimes Issues are public and sometimes they are private.\n\nIn a public repo, anyone with a GitHub username can create and comment on issues.\nIn a private repo, only users with permission can create and comment on issues, or see them at all\n\nGitHub search is awesome – it will search all of your files and Issues!",

    "text": "Issues in the Wild\nHere are some examples of “traditional” and “non-traditional” use of issues.\nggplot2’s Issues is an example of what I think is the “traditional” use of Issues, which is in a pretty pure software development context. This is a public repository, and all topics are directly related to ggplot2. Issues are largely used to report bugs, troubleshoot and sometimes to request features. Note the “Filters” feature on the top-left: this by default will search through the Issues that are still open, but you can also change this if you wanted to search also for closed Issues (just below “Filters” you can see that there are over 2000 closed Issues, documenting the innovation that’s been ongoing in ggplot2).\n\n\n\nMozillaFestival’s Issues are an example of a less “traditional”, but increasingly common use of Issues: for project submissions, coordination, and community engagement. It is also an example of the use of labels: those colorful tags that help group and categorize the Issues. To the right of “Filters”, you’ll see a “Labels” button: clicking on this will give you a list of all the labels and how many Issues are tagged with each label.\n\n\n\nOHI-Science’s Issues: are also an example of less “traditional” use of Issues but perhaps also somewhat common. This is a private repository, which is why there is no link to these Issues. Here, Issues are used for private conversations and archiving ideas and discussions: the OHI-Science team uses issues instead of email to have private, archived, searchable conversations about scientific methods. We are diligent about having important science conversations in these Issues, rather than those conversations being lost in emails or Slack. This is more organized and also makes onboarding team members much smoother since we do not need to forward emails to new team members.",

    "section": "How to use Issues",
    "text": "How to use Issues\nLet’s do a demo with Issues.\n\nCreating a new Issue\nWhen you click on the green “New Issue” button”, you’re asked to give a Title and Leave a Comment. You can also attach files or images by dragging them into the Issue.\nThen you’ll be able to Submit the Issue. On the right side, you’ll see options to Assign someone to the Issue, add a Label, add it to a Project, or add it to a Milestone. We’ll explore these features a bit more in a moment.\n\n\n\nWhen you click Submit, your Issue gets a number, which is now written next to the title. This number is also part of the URL as well.\nOn the right of the Title, note that there is an “Edit” button if you ever need to change the title of the Issue as the conversation evolves. The Issue number will stay the same.\nWhat happens if you want to edit the text of your Comment after you’ve Submitted it? No problem. See that once you’ve submitted an Issue, there is a blue bar at the top of the Comment, attributing your username to this comment along with the date. At the very right of this blue bar, there are 3 dots. Clicking here will give you the option to edit.\n\n\nCommenting\nThe great thing about Issues is that they are for conversations with yourself and others. So once you’ve submitted an Issue, you can string together additional Comments within this comment. Maybe you asked a question, and someone else will respond with a solution or idea. They might link to an Issue with a related topic, or an external link that might be helpful.\nYou can also tag people in Issue Comments with the “@” symbol. As noted above, anyone who is part of the repository will automatically get email notifications when comments are submitted. But tagging specific users will also send them an email, and is a good way to bring folks into the conversation who might not already be “watching” the whole repository. In a public repository you can tag any GitHub user, and in a private repository they have to have permission.\nEach time there is a comment in the Issue thread, there will be a new date marked in the blue bar at the top of the Issue. This is a nice way to see how current conversations are.\nAnd something really great is that you can click on the date — and watch the URL change. This allows you to anchor to a specific comment within the Issue thread. This is really useful if, for example, you wanted to share a specific comment with someone else instead of having them scroll down themselves. (Note: you can also click on the three dots at the right of the blue Comment header to copy the anchored link).\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown\nIssues support Markdown. This means that you can add simple formatting to your text, such as headers, bold and italics, lists, images, links, and formatted code. To help you use Markdown formatting as you learn, GitHub Issues have built-in help: there are icons between the Title and the Comment of the Issue that will do the Markdown formatting for you, and help you learn along the way.\nThere is also a “Preview” tab between the Title and Comment (next to the “Write” tab, where you are by default) where you can preview what your Markdown formatting looks like before you Submit the Issue. Submitting the Issue will also render the Markdown formatting.\nGitHub enables you to also create Markdown check-lists by typing - [ ]. Once this is rendered, you can click it to check this box. Alternatively, in Markdown you check a box by typing - [x]. The number of checked and unchecked items will be visible in the Issue as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinking to files\nLinking to specific files or versions of files is good practice when you are discussing it in an Issue: reduce the work for the person reading the Issue (which might be Future You!). You can link to the file by opening it in the browser and copying its URL and placing it in Markdown formatting for hyperlinks: [text to hyperlink](URL).\nYou can also navigate to a specific version of that file, or a specific commit message, if you want to capture that file at a specific point in time.\nYou can also anchor to specific lines within a file, which is useful if you are requesting feedback on a specific part of an analysis or asking for help troubleshooting. I can send someone to a specific place within a file with the appropriate lines highlighted. For example [important code](https://github.com/Openscapes/issues-demo/blob/master/code-example.R#L12-L13) will render as important code.\n\n \n\n\nAssigning, Labels\nOn the right side of the Issue thread, there is the “metadata” for the Issue. You can assign the Issue to a specific user, or label it with a suite of labels that you can customize (when you click on labels, see all the way at the bottom the option to edit labels. And there are other ways to navigate there as well).\nIf you navigate back to the full list of Issue topics (which will have the URL github.com/username-or-organization/repo-name/issues), you’ll see these metadata categories listed at the top as well, which lets you filter or view based on these categories.\n\n \n\n\nProjects, Milestones\nProjects and Milestones are further ways to organize and track progress with your Issues.\nProjects are a way to organize and prioritize your issues. It uses the idea of a Kanban board, which Wikipedia says “visually depict work at various stages of a process using cards to represent work items and columns to represent each stage of the process. Cards are moved from left to right to show progress and to help coordinate teams performing the work.” The simplest have 3 columns labeled “to do”, “doing” and “done”.\nYou can use Projects for both Organization or personal projects. In fact, you can have multiple projects within the same repository, so different people can have different Projects organized within their shared repository, for example.\nYou have a lot of control over how you will manage your Projects; at this point I do not use all the features but have been playing around with using them for Openscapes planning:\n\n\n\nMilestones are a way to attach deadlines to your Project (although you do not need to identify a date if you don’t want to). Once you create a Milestone, you can add Issues to that Milestone to help track progress. For example, maybe you have a presentation coming up and there are several Issues that need to be addressed before then.",

It helps to consider the purpose for the Issues.\nUsing Issues for “traditional” bug/features for code, it makes sense to keep the repository public and have all Issues pertaining to that repo there within that repo.\nIf you’re using Issues for “non-traditional” laboratory research group and science conversations, there are other considerations. Maybe you do want a private repository, but even so you’ll want to think ahead. Will you eventually make that repo public when you publish your study? Changing a repo from private to public (or vice versa, both are possible in the repository’s Settings) will make not only the code and files of that repo public, but also all the Issues. Which is fine, but it might add considerations in terms of what is discussed in those Issues.\n\nOHI example\nHere is an example of the Ocean Health Index team’s thought process & strategy.\nOur team works within a GitHub Organization called “OHI-Science”. Within that Organization, we work in many repositories, with different combinations of people working primarily within different repositories. Sanity-wise, we didn’t want to have conversations in Issues within each of those repositories because it would make finding those conversations more difficult (although now GitHub can search all Issues/code across an Organization!).\nWe also wanted our repos to be public, but to have private conversations using the Issues feature.\nThese two needs led us to create a single private repository named “issues”, and we only use it for Issues. This works really well for us, especially since our team lead can engage in these discussions by receiving emails about the Issues in his inbox, and can respond without having to go to GitHub.com.",

This has been around for years, taking care of bookkeeping for you locally on your computer.\nGitHub makes git’s local bookkeeping collaborative through its powerful online platform. It will weave together all the version control from your local computer with other collaborators you work with.\nIt is used for code and files: organize, archive, bookkeeping, searchable, changes visualized, etc. In the figure below, notice the familiar red and green to denote deletions and additions line-by-line, with darker shading to identify specific text within a line. Also notice the differencing in the image’s color bar!\n\n \nWe aren’t going to teach traditional git/GitHub today, but here are some recommendations if you’d like to learn. First, read Jenny Bryan’s “Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?” (open-access pre-print from PeerJ, published in The American Statistican). This provides an excellent overview. One quote I like in particular is\n\nCollaboration is the most compelling reason to manage a project with Git and GitHub. My definition of collaboration includes hands-on participation by multiple people, including your past and future self, as well as an asymmetric model, in which some people are active makers and others only read or review. - Jenny Bryan, “Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?”\n\nNext, to learn GitHub with R, the absolute best resource is Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git With R. This is a comprehensive, friendly step-by-step process of how to do so, and is an awesome reference for seasoned git/GitHub users as well. If you want a shorter-form resource, I’d recommend 2 tutorials from R for Excel Users. This also teaches you how to set up GitHub to sync directly through RStudio, so that you don’t have to have any other software (including the command line) open to do so:\n\nGitHub\nCollaborating with GitHub\n\nOn my local computer, I interact with GitHub through RStudio 99.9% of the time (use command line .1% of time).",

They are essentially a folder, and you’ll put files and folders in them. They are contained, with permissions specific to each one.\nIt makes it easier to navigate through and find stuff — so you are “not sifting through a zoo of files” as one Openscapes Champion has said.\n\n\n“Commits” & “commit messages”\nUnlike Dropbox or Google Drive that constantly and automatically sync to the cloud, you have to deliberately tell git/GitHub when you have an amount of work that you want to be versioned and synced. You have to commit to telling them. GitHub takes care of the backend bookkeeping involved, but you have to write a human-readable message to your future self and others. That is the commit message.\nThere is no absolute guidance for how often to commit, but I think of it as leaving breadcrumbs for yourself. How much work and on what things/in what combination would you like to be able to reverse? What kind of information will make it easier for Future You to work with?\n\n\nPublic vs private\nYou can have both public (the free default) and private repositories, and change these permissions later on. I mostly work in public repos, but if I work in private ones, I often have the expectation that they will be made public some day. So I practice good habits with commits and documentation, and keep conversations on-topic.\n\n\nThe search feature is awesome\nYou are able to search within a GitHub repository, across repositories in an organization, or across all GitHub public repositories. I find this helps me find things quickly if I’m looking for how I’ve used a function in the past, or if I remember a word that would stand out that I included in a commit message as a breadcrumb to myself. It will also search Issues within the repositories, so you can look for specific words in conversations as well.\n\n\nBranches & Forks\nWe’re not going to talk about branches and forks. These are a core feature of what makes GitHub super powerful for software development, and one of the first things you’ll see in GitHub tutorials geared towards software engineers. But I do not think that is the most relevant or smoothest entryway for those of us who are scientists fairly new to collaborative coding and version control.",

    "text": "Open data science key concepts\n\nData science as a discipline\nData science is “the discipline of turning raw data into understanding” (Wickham & Grolemund 2016, R for Data Science).\nThere are concepts, theory, and tools for thinking about and working with data. Just like a field chemistry has concepts for things like moleculte, theory for how they work, and tools for studying them, so does data science — for data.\nAn alternative title to this section would be “data science is a thing”: no matter what your study system or your question, there are discernible steps involved that when you embrace will make you more efficient. These steps are illustrated in this figure from Wickham & Grolemund: you will need to import/get your data into analytical software, wrangle it (tidy and transform), and THEN you can start understanding your data and asking your science questions by making sense of it visually and with models.\n\n\n\n\nImage from R for Data Science by Wickham & Grolemund\n\n\nTidying your data before asking your science questions is a critical point here. Don’t build your whole analysis around whatever weird format your data may have come in. Data tidying (“data wrangling”, “data prep”) can take up to 50–80% of a data scientist’s time (Lohr 2014, New York Times).\n\nMindset: Decouple your research questions from data questions, get help sooner\n\nData science also has an emphasis on communication. It is incredible what is possible on the communication front. This this one-minute video called What is RMarkdown? shows some of the possibilities.\nData science is not just for “big data” or AI or machine learning. You can use data science theory and tools no matter the size or context of your data.\nAnother important reason to think about data science as a discipline is that it helps dispell the idea that your study system is somehow unique - this is not the case when it comes to data. Distinguish data questions from research questions, learn how to ask for help. Don’t confound them or it will be really hard to iterate (for example, when you want to explore a subset like a specific year or place).\nExpect there is a way to do what you want to do. This will help you find commonalities and unite you with other members of your research group, and beyond.\n\n“When I was doing my PhD, I confounded my science questions with my data questions. I was studying squid, asking questions that no one had ever asked before. But I needed to reformat some dates in Matlab. I treated this date-formatting task also as something that no one had ever asked before. I was looking in the cephalopod literature for guidance; I couldn’t step back and decouple this data question from my squid question, and I struggled for much, much longer because of it.” - Julie Lowndes\n\nOpen data science tools exist - tools to match data science theory.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Wickham 2017, Welcome to the tidyverse\n\n\nAs Hadley Wickham described in his slides Welcome to the tidyverse, tooling exists for every step of this conceptual diagram. They exist to streamline working with data.\nThese tools are developed by actual people – nice people!\n\n\nOpen as a way to work\nOpen science is a daily benefit: it is a way to be efficient & streamlined. It is not just an added ask to share data at publication. It’s not only about sharing data. It’s about how you work, who you include, and the tools that you use. It starts with reuse: when you leverage existing resources, spend less time reinventing. It starts off with yourself: be open with yourself and your team first.\nOpen means easier onboarding – personal and collective. A focus on inclusive documentation and operations means that it is easier to return to a project, whether it’s picking up where you left off last month or when you’re handing it off to another person. It’s like an external memory (personal and collective).\nOpen requires trust and safety – starting with your team. Psychological safety is a big part of open.\nOpen is a spectrum – what you share, who you share it with, or how you share it. It’s not all-or-nothing.\n\nWhat: slides, tweets, blogs, forums, wikis… then also code, data, protocols\nWho: your self, research group, project team, institution…then also public\nHow: internal servers, DropBox…then also Google Drive, GitHub, data repos\n\n\nMindset: Increasingly weave open into your work so it’s easier to share as you need\n\nOpen helps you find solutions faster as you learn to talk about your data, express your needs, and recognize solutions.\nOpen helps you build confidence – skills are transferable beyond your science. Working openly requires being empathic and inclusive – this will grow a network of allies.\n\n\nResearch group as a team\nFocus on common parts that unite you, not what sets you apart.\nBuild horizontal leadership & resilience so that there is less reinventing, less knowledge lost, less loneliness. Think of the lab horizontally as skillsets & needs instead of vertically as science bins\nIt’s about diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging: Instead of the skills you have when you come to the group determining how you will be able to Do Science, co-create shared practices and deliberate paths to onboard new people, and skill-share to continue learning together.\n\nMindset: What do our workflows have in common and how can we learn from each other\n\nScience is collaborative. Let’s make it less heads down elbows out.\n\n\nCollaborators & community (redefined) as a way to learn\nLearn from, with, and for others. This helps overcome isolation, self-taught bad practices, apprehension (Stevens et al. 2018). It helps you transform from “self-taught” to “community-taught”.\n\n“We learn from others by using their code and documentation, their blogs and tutorials, their talks and webinars. We learn with others online through Twitter, discussion forums and Slack channels, and in person through coding clubs, hacky hours, meetups, workshops and conferences. And we learn for others by writing tutorials and blogs about our own learning processes, or adding or fulfilling feature requests, which we can then contribute back to the community.” - Lowndes 2019, Open Software Means Kinder Science\n\nUse the Internet more for science (it is such an underleveraged tool!). Learn and connect through Twitter, blogs, forums, new comms outlets…(It is such a cool time to be a scientist).\n\n\n\nExample open communities and Tweet\n\n\n\nMindset: Engage as feels right but know you’re not alone",

Together we’ll work on changing habits to improve your work and teamwork so you shape where you invest based on what you need. We’ll develop a practice of reflecting, talking, and collaborating about data workflows with your team and community. You’ll leave with a tangible Pathway (a planning document) that your team will use to help identify current practices and prioritize next steps. Your team will share your Pathway as work-in-progress during our last Cohort Call. Champions have found the Pathway valuable to communicate their needs and plans and to share with supervisors as a concrete outcome.\nProcess: through facilitated Cohort Calls, team-driven Seaside Chats & Coworking, and How We Work (how we describe technical and cultural norms); Read on to learn more about these below.

    "text": "Seaside Chats & Coworking\nBetween Cohort Calls, teams have synchronous spaces via Seaside Chats and Coworking to meet, ask questions, and exchange knowledge. Seaside Chats and Coworking have been described by participants as one of the most valuable parts of the Champions Program because it helps strengthen habits and a culture of shared workflows and learning.\nSeaside Chats (Lowndes et al. 2019) are when a team meets together independently for dedicated time for data/workflow discussions This is where teams talk and screenshare to begin identifying and addressing shared needs: Everyone has something to learn, ask, teach; don’t need to be an expert in everything. Seaside Chats can include others that are not participating in the Champions Cohort. We’ll provide suggestions for these meetings aligned with the Pathways Document to organize your thoughts. The main purpose is to focus on your work at hand and build the habit of talking about and strengthening shared workflows with your broader group. We suggest you schedule these Seaside Chats with your team as soon as possible.\nFurther, we facilitate optional Coworking sessions. Coworking comes in different flavors. For Champions Cohorts, coworking involves doing our own work at the same time together with opportunities to check in, and sometimes screenshare to get feedback or solve a problem. Seeing how other people work is a big part of this transition to working more openly and collaboratively. Some teams join Coworking together, meeting for their Seaside Chat in a breakout room with the option of talking to others in the Cohort. We will share optional Coworking times where you are welcome to come do your own work in a social setting.",

    "text": "How We Work\n“How We Work” refers to the technical and cultural norms we will establish during the Champions Cohort, which we developed through our Openscapes Flywheel (Robinson and Lowndes 2022). These approaches have become some of the most valuable things teams take with them through the Champions Program, and we love hearing how folks are taking these practices to new places as they grow as leaders.\n\nWelcome\nWe are intentional to create a welcoming environment, through art, design, and clear norms. You are all welcome here. We are creating a positive learning space where everyone is welcome to ask questions and participate. We’ll start off each call with a reminder of our Code of Conduct.\n\n\nSpace & Place\nTogether we will be creating space and place to learn, collaborate, and create shared workflows so that we aren’t all responsible for this alone.\nOur Cohort will have a single shared folder (via Google Drive/ Microsoft Teams) that we will share ahead of time and will be linked from the calendar invite. This will have all resources specific to our Cohort. Each Cohort Call will have a highly-structured Agenda document so you know what is planned — and so you can more easily catch up if your internet drops out. We use headers so that you can navigate via the Table of Contents view. (In Google Docs, you can enable Outline view by selecting View &gt; Show outline.) These agendas are for live-note taking throughout the Cohort Call. It is our shared responsibility to contribute & help document for future us; this is the main place for nonverbal contribution, side conversations, and to reinforce ideas.\n\n\n\n\nExample computer setup with Zoom & Google Docs side-by-side with windows narrowed to enable seeing faces and writing in the shared document. Credit: The Fay Lab\n\n\nDuring Cohort Calls, we encourage videos on (“faces on”) – but it is okay if this is not possible for any reason. In Zoom, you can enable Gallery View by clicking Settings &gt; Video &gt; Display up to 49 participants. We ask you to mute liberally/quickly to reduce background noise – but please unmute to speak up at any point. You’ll interact in small groups via breakout groups, this will help you reflect on your work and get to know each other.\nWe have a flipped approach to screensharing. This shows up in two ways. First, we do not screenshare slides while presenting. Instead we provide links to slides and presenters indicate when everyone should advance to the next slide. This minimizes bandwith issues and enables everyone to zoom in, click on links, linger, and go back, as they prefer. Second, we do screenshare to demonstrate keyboard shortcuts, live examples of how we work, and troubleshoot. Screensharing to show current practices and ask for help is a big part of Coworking sessions and Seaside Chats.\nAt the start of each Cohort, we send Google Calendar invites to everyone for all Cohort Calls and optional Coworking sessions. These include the Zoom link (or Teams / Google Meet) to join, and a link to the Cohort’s shared Google Folder so we don’t all have to hunt for those each time.\nWe start and end on time.\n\n\nLearning & Trust\nLearning new things is uncomfortable and it can feel vulnerable to ask questions. Through creating a welcoming space we can invest in learning and trust together. We know there is a range of technical experience – by design! We are all here because we want to learn and improve our work around data-intensive science. We’re all imperfect and learning together – Openscapes team included. We’re all accountable to each other.\nExamples of how teams strengthen learning and trust within their groups are captured in our Pathways share in the final Cohort Call. Common themes are, meeting regularly, knowing who and where to ask for help, and building shared documentation and resources to reduce emails asking where things are.\n\n\nWork Openly\nWe role model working openly throughout the Cohort by sharing ideas, resources, and screensharing. All our resources are created with the same tools we teach research teams (R, GitHub, Google Drive) and shared openly. During Cohort Calls, our Agenda and open facilitation style is part of working openly — we iterate openly as facilitators and mentors, for example through adjusting the timing live in the Agenda document.\nWe send Digests the week following each Cohort Call (early, on Monday or Tuesday). Each digest includes the Call’s goals, links to the Call’s agenda, slides, and recording, and some excerpts from the shared notes. These provide a touch point in the week between Calls. See examples: 2022-nasa-champions, 2022-noaa-afsc, 2021-fdd.\nMany teams begin working more openly via shared documentation, project management, metadata, file organization and naming, and code organization and interoperability, using tools like Google Drive/Microsoft Teams, GitHub, R, and Python.\n\n\nCommon Workflows\nWe reuse what works from other places in our work (we sometimes talk about this as “forking”, borrowing a term from GitHub where you make a copy in your own workspace so you don’t have to start from scratch). This often shows up in Champions Cohorts with teams reusing the Agendas structure and the concepts of Seaside Chats and Coworking with their broader research groups.\nWe discuss practices from different open communities, and teams contribute so that others can build from their work as well.\n\n\nInspire\nStorytelling and sharing what works is so valuable for others to learn from and be inspired by. Many concepts and possibilities are new, so there is value in the idea of “show me” in a way that resonates.\nInspiring others happens in small moments, that can look like someone leaning forward in their chair saying “I want to do that” when someone else is screensharing during Coworking. It can mean asking for 5 minutes at the start of a meeting to share something new you learned. These moments also build up to real culture change as folks give talks to their organizational leadership and broader open communities, and the Flywheel turns again.",

Additional suggested reading include:\nOur path to better science in less time using open data science tools (Lowndes et al. 2017). This describes a marine science team’s transition to open collaborative teamwork. It was the original inspiration for creating the Champions Program and heavily influences the Core Lessons.\nSupercharge your research: a ten-week plan for open data science (Lowndes et al. 2019). This was co-authored with the inaugural Champions Cohort, capturing the most valuable take-aways for marine and environmental science early career faculty.\nSee also other publications and presentations at openscapes.org/media.",

    "text": "About\nOpenscapes is an approach and a movement that helps researchers and those supporting research find each other and feel empowered to conduct data-intensive science. Through a creative approach drawing inspiration and skills from many places, we provide structures for technical skill-building, collaborative teamwork, and inclusive community development. Our work builds from many others in the open movement.\nRead more about How We Work:\n\nOpenscapes Approach Guide\nThe Openscapes Flywheel: A framework for managers to facilitate and scale inclusive Open science practices (Robinson & Lowndes 2022)\n3 lessons from remote meetings we’re taking back to the office (Lowndes, Cabunoc Mayes & Sansing 2020)\n\n\nThis Series Book\nThe Series is written (and always improving) to be used as a reference, to teach, as self-paced learning, and for reuse and remix. And also, awesomely, it’s created with the same tools and practices we will be talking about: R/RStudio - originally bookdown and now quarto - and GitHub.\n\n\nCitation\nAll material in the Openscapes Lesson Series is available under a CC-BY 4.0 licence.\nPlease cite the Openscapes Champions Lesson Series through the project’s Zenodo archive using DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.7407246.
