title: Open communities
---

Open communities play a big role in advancing research, helping research feel less lonely and reducing the amount of time we all spend being stuck spend reinventing the wheel. This is a brief (incomplete) introduction to the idea of open communities. We will explore: What are open communities? Why engage with them? How to engage with them? And also how Twitter as a legit tool for coding and science. Originally focusing on R communities, we are adding more examples beyond.

**Slides** that have been presented during Champions Program Cohort Calls:

-   [Open Communities](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17HSNmBYvPw-7Prioys7WIhL9QGVb3s3bJCLaAJVaChc/edit?usp=sharing), which we go through in a Cohort Call
-   [Discovering Community Tools](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1czvMz7a84jkaYDwHlG1cuKyf9B0mciQJVOFcc7hZtpU/edit?usp=sharing), which teams review during a Seaside Chat

## What are open communities?

Open communities are groups of people openly creating, sharing, teaching, collaborating. They are united around a shared interest: coding language, topic, discipline, etc.

They have a culture of shared & continued learning, prioritize diversity, equity, inclusion.

They have online and in-person activities.

Here are some examples of communities. Read more & direct links: <https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/collaborating.html#r-communities>

There are strategies for learning with both online and local communities.

## Why engage with open communities?

-   Skillshare (teach & learn)
    -   Coding, software, workflows
    -   Collaboration, leadership, DEIJ
-   Meet allies, grow friendships, career opportunities
-   Help improve science & scientific culture
    -   Increase visibility & value of coding, data, collaboration skills
    -   Drive change: modern ways to contribute to science. Formally incentivize and teach! Include in promotion/tenure (we shouldn't really have to teach ourselves on our own time and not be credited), create jobs
-   Carry on & forward your experience from Openscapes

## How to get started?

Google your interests/needs. When you Google, include what you want to do PLUS r, rstats; python.

Start by listening and learning. Be deliberate: curate who you follow.

Like and share when you're comfortable.

Then, contribute -- your ideas, your blogs, your papers, your code... Contributors are welcome in open communities! And know too that the R packages ggplot & knitr were created by students (Wickham & Xie) (see [McBain 2019](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/our-colour-of-magic-the-open-sourcery-of-fantastic-r-packages)).

Finally, Twitter is a legit tool for science. It's a good way to learn what you need to learn and broadening your horizons while building community. Some places to start: `#rstats, #rstatsES, #rspatial, #pydata, #BlackAndSTEM, #MeTooSTEM`

[Seaside Chats](https://github.com/Openscapes/seaside-chats#seaside-chats) are a great way to start exploring together.
