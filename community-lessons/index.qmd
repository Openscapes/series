## NASA Openscapes Cloud Tutorials

The NASA Earthdata-Openscapes Mentors team and other contributors are creating open educational resources to help researchers migrate workflows to the Cloud - all available for reuse and remix.

<https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/tutorials.html>

Check out the 2021-Cloud-Hackathon materials!

## NMFS Openscapes 

The overarching vision of the NMFS Openscapes is to support scientific researchers within NOAA Fisheries by providing training in reproducible scientific workflows and platforms, facilitating collaboration across divisions in common scientific data science tasks, and providing shared "best practices" resources.

Check out the NMFS R UG (R Users Group) for upcoming events and Wiki for links to resources and examples of open science at NOAA Fisheries.

## Fay Lab Manual

This is the lab manual for the Fay Lab at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth School for Marine Science and Technology.

<https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/> 

Check out how they've organized this onboarding document that prospective students and postdocs have said stood out to them. Consider reusing/remixing for your own group!

## Allison Horst - open educational resources

Allison Horst shares many open educational resources, including workshops and slides, at <https://www.allisonhorst.com/>: 

>"I actively work to contribute to open educational resources, including software for data science education (e.g. the [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) R dataset package), and artwork for data science & stats teachers and learners. From 2019 - 2020 I was RStudioâ€™s first Artist-in-Residence. You can read more about my motivation in that role in [this blog post](https://www.rstudio.com/blog/artist-in-residence/), and you can find some of my R- and stats-related artwork [in this repo](https://github.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations)."

Allison teaches environmental data science at UCSB (see her courses at <https://ucsb-meds.github.io/>).
