It improved iteratively and the most recent version always openly available online. Chapters in this book accompany slide decks and agendas for the Champions program Cohort Calls. Cohort Calls are when cohorts of ~7 research teams (~28 individuals) convene remotely to explore open data science practices. We are testing and learning from Cohorts of different durations as we continue to improve and grow Openscapes. Below are agendas from 2-month, 4-month, and 2-day iterations. Openscapes Champions is a professional development and leadership opportunity for research teams to explore open data science practices. It is a remote-by-design mentorship program that guides teams through the open data science landscape, empowers them as leaders, and welcomes them as part of the growing open community. Participants attend as a team with their research group — including the team lead — in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden. A driving motivation is to reduce the burden for early career faculty/leads wanting to modernize their research groups’ approaches to collaborative data analysis and stewardship. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/RStudio, GitHub, metadata), research groups develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science, enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact. The lesson series is originally framed around Lowndes et al. 2017, Nature Ecology &amp; Evolution: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools. That paper is a retrospective of how a team’s data workflow changed over four years; Openscapes Champions aims to help guide other teams to accelerate this timeline and begin make similar progress themselves, no matter where they are starting from. 1.1 Agendas Cohorts of research groups participate in the Champions program over several months, with 2 Cohort Calls each month (1.5 hours each). Calls are designed to be engaging, requiring discussion and active participation through live-notetaking in Google Docs and video Zoom (group and breakouts). Call agendas and slides are all openly available in a Google Folder, and identified individually in the following tables. As we continue to learn and iterate from working with different research groups, you can always review previous agendas for specific cohorts. Additionally, we end each lesson by learning hands-on efficiency tips, compiled here as an Efficiency Tips Doc and Spreadsheet. 1.1.1 Remote, 2-month In the 2-month remote program, research groups participate in 4 Cohort Calls.

And also, awesomely, it’s created with the same tools and practices we will be talking about: R and RStudio — specifially bookdown — and GitHub. Openscapes is co-directed by Julia Stewart Lowndes and Erin Robinson. It is operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis &amp; Synthesis (NCEAS) and was incubated by a Mozilla Fellowship awarded to Lowndes in 2018.

Our vision is a scientific culture that is more efficient and collaborative, and can uncover environmental solutions faster. This Series is going to be fun and empowering! We will talk about a lot of tools and practices to make your science more streamlined. This is really powerful, cool stuff, and not just for data: I made and published this book using the tools and workflows we’ll talk about. The first half of the Series focuses on efficiency and open culture within the lab, and the second half is about sustained learning and bringing these practices to the broader campus community. 2.1 Why we’re here We are passionate environmental scientists studying important, time-sensitive topics using data of all kinds. And we were never taught to work efficiently with data. We are here because I know these files are on your computer — we all have them. data_final_final.xls data_final_usethis.xls ... thesis_v16_new_ch1.docx thesis_v16.docx ... And we also send and receive emails with subject lines like: Re:FWD:Fwd:Data question Re:Sending again with the correct version We are going to talk about how to make the data experience better, for you, your lab, your department, and beyond. Data analysis can be inefficient and demoralizing when you’re without the right tools/skills and you feel alone. But! Open tools, practices, and communities exist that are powerful and empowering, and game-changing for science. And we can learn and use open practices for science. They are like the Force from Star Wars: More powerful than you ever imagined Helps you solve your current question powerfully – but also broadens the scope of the questions you can ask Learn from jedis, pass on what you have learned, have a ton of awesome allies (and not all allies are jedis) 2.2 What to expect 2.2.1 This is going to be fun and empowering! We are going to be discussing a wide range of topics and working to seed habits for you to engage and learn with them with our lab and others on campus. 2.2.2 Exposure to relevant tools &amp; practices, confidence &amp; agency to engage, community to learn with The plan is to expose you to a lot of great tools and practices that you can have confidence using in your research. We will also spend time helping you plan how to actually incrementally weave them into your existing workflows. The point is not to overwhelm you or make you feel like it’s too late for you or that you would need to throw out and redo everything you’ve ever done in order to take the first step. No. By seeing what’s possible and how shared practices can make your own life easier, and life easier and more streamlined and fun with your lab and beyond, you’ll start experimenting with these practices and in a few years you will be working in a completely different way. 2.2.3 Create a shared culture – in your lab, on campus, and beyond We’re going to go through a lot and it’s less important that you remember it all. More importantly, you’ll know what is possible, have confidence that you can do it, and have allies so you’re not alone. The main thing to take away is that there are good ways to approach your analyses; we will teach you to expect that so you can find what you need and use it! A theme throughout is that tools exist and are being developed by real, and extraordinarily nice, people to meet you where you are and help you do what you need to do. If you expect and appreciate that, you will be more efficient in doing your awesome science. 2.2.4 No skills required. We will strategize about general approaches, specific examples using R/RStudio and GitHub There are no skills required to participate, and we will not be teaching hands-on how to code or set up databases. But we will be talking about how these are important and fit together in the big picture, and how to get started learning the skills you need. This is an opportunity to discuss existing tools and how to engage, meet other labs, discuss next steps, and stay accountable. We’ll talk about tools and practices broadly, but also with specific examples using R and GitHub. Won’t that software eventually become outdated you say — is it worth learning them over something else? The answer is yes, software will change and become outdated; it always has. But seeing what is possible and becoming versed in embracing existing architecture and practices will set you up to make whatever transition comes, and you will make this transition with the community, not along. Your skills will be transferrable skills as the actual software changes. Analogy: if you learn one musical instrument, you will be able to learn another one more fluidly than if you have never learned one to begin with because maybe you can read music, understand something about timing and rhythm, etc. 2.2.5 Everyone is coming with different experiences &amp; expectations Everyone in this workshop is coming from a different place with different experiences and expectations. But everyone will learn something new here, because there is so much innovation in the data science world. You are encouraged to ask questions and answer those of others. 2.2.6 We are all learning together These tools are new to all of us, and the best ideas come from questions from anyone. If you are already familiar with some of this material, think about how your experience was learning it, and how you might teach it to others. Use these workshop materials not only as a reference in the future but also for talking points so you can communicate the importance of these tools to your communities. A big part of this Series is not only for you to learn these skills, but for you to also teach others and increase the value and practice of open data science in science as a whole. 2.2.7 Vulnerability: yes! Shame: no. Shame is not allowed here. No “I’m 34 and haven’t learned GitHub, it’s too late for me” or any of that. We have never had the opportunity to learn these things, there should be no shame on your part for that. It takes a lot of time and dedicated effort to learn and employ these practices, and they should be valued and taught. That’s why you’re here now, you should be proud that you are taking the initiative and your time to do this. No shame. Vulnerability, however, will be involved in this Series. Vulnerability is a big part of learning and trying new things — this is a safe place for everyone to learn. Vulnerability is taking stock of where you are now and help you map out where you want to be. Being vulnerable is scary. But it shouldn’t be lonely: we all have data confessions that would love to talk about and get help with, if only our scientific culture said that was OK; if only we knew how to articulate our questions and have someone to ask. This is a place to share our vulnerabilities to ignite real change. Ask questions. Whether it’s a keyboard shortcut or philosophy of data workflows, ask and let’s talk about it. 2.2.8 Everyone is welcome here You are all welcome here, please be respectful of one another. We are setting a tone of mutual respect and a space place for learning where we assume good intentions and interact with kindness and empathy. Pass it on. 2.3 What’s possible with open data science (demo) R for automation, visualizations github for collaborating (code, text) bookdown websites github for project management organize by project, i.e., keep that code and those methods in same parent folder, rather than all the R code you’ve ever written being in a giant folder, spanning projects public &amp; private issues, tagging people on commits, kaban board Live: fix a tpyo and republish the book/page 2.4 What we’ll learn 2.4.1 Expect that there is a better way Seeing what’s possible opens up what you expect. There is a bit of a chicken and egg issue here: you need to be exposed to things so you know what’s possible and what skills to develop, but you need to kind of know what to look for so you can absorb what you are exposed to. 2.4.2 Have agency to find it Break down that “I teach you learn” model. We are all here to learn and improve. Learning horizontally. This series is not about micro-managing your science but about providing guidance &amp; structure so that everyone in the lab is not silently struggling to reinvent the wheel and coming up with weird homegrown data approaches. What skills you should have and what you should be thinking of, along with some of the tools you can use. Will be building out the Resources page on the website for this purpose. And search the blogs. 2.4.3 Have community to learn with No more silently struggling &amp; reinventing the wheel &amp; creating weird, homegrown workarounds. Embrace emerging and established community best practices 2.4.4 Identify what skills and tools you need, map next steps &amp; learn 2.5 Deliverables aka Outcomes. Be champions for open data science (in your groups, departments, communities.) A more open culture in your group dedicated lab meetings to discuss data workflows “Seaside chats” (&lt;- this is what we call them at OHI) stated code of conduct or lab group philosophy beginnings of a lab roadmap of shared data workflows A growing community of practice on campus study groups / coding clubs (ex: Eco-Data-Science) hacky hours 2.5.1 What would you do in a Seaside Chat? Example topics from the Ocean Health Index: Let’s have READMEs so we know what the heck things are Set up Zotero with RMarkdown Filepath woes: use .Rprojects Where to put data – here’s how our server works Filepath woes 2: use the new here package! Let’s plan a lab “hackathon” to move these .xls to .csv files we store on Github 2.5.2 What would you do in a Study Group? Example lessons from Eco-Data-Science (&lt;- all lessons linked “previous sessions”) Introduction to GitHub Text analysis in R Spatial analysis in R Free websites with RMarkdown Animated plots in R with ggplot2 &amp; gganimate Intro to Python 2.5.3 Assignments There will be assignments between each call that should take about two hours over two weeks. Assignments are designed to be done during lab “Seaside chats,” weekly meetings to discuss data workflows and establish shared practices. Assigned after each call. Do them collaboratively during lab “Seaside chats.” They should take take 2 hours (over 2 weeks).

Open data science tools, practices, &amp; communities exist and are powerful and empowering, and game-changing for science. They enable us to do better science in less time. They are like the Force from Star Wars: More powerful than you ever imagined Enable you to broaden the scope of the questions you can ask You can be a Jedi to others: pass forward what you’ve learned You can join &amp; build diverse communities of allies (not all allies are Jedis) We can harness this power for science more broadly. We can create the culture that we want to be a part of – towards kinder science. We can do this with the Openscapes mindset: Be efficient, open, collaborative, inclusive, and kind Reframe data analysis as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden or personal craft Redefine collaborators &amp; community: Future You, Future Us Think like a team: share imperfect work and learn together Beyond your own discipline, and online Reimagine challenges: Expect there is a better way Iterate with confidence, agency, &amp; community You’re not alone, it’s not too late Our approach to help develop this mindset is by focusing on the following: Data science as a discipline Open as a way to work Group members as a team Collaborators and community (redefined) as a way to learn The Internet as an underleveraged tool for science 3.1 Data science as a discipline Alternative title: “Data science is a thing.” No matter what your study system or your question, to Do Your Science you will need to get your data into analytical software, wrangle it (tidy and transform), and make sense of it visually and with models. Very important here: tidy your data first, don’t build your whole analysis around whatever weird format your data may have come in. We’ll talk about tidy data in more detail another day. R for Data Science 3.1.1 There are concepts, theory, and tools for thinking about and working with data Just like a field chemistry has concepts for things like moleculte, theory for how they work, and tools for studying them, so does data science — for data. 3.1.2 Emphasis on communication It is incredible what is possible on the communication front. Watch this one-minute video called What is RMarkdown? to blow your mind. 3.1.3 Not just for “big data” or AI or machine learning You can use data science theory and tools no matter the size or context of your data. 3.1.4 Your study system is not unique when it comes to data Think about your data separately from your study system. Don’t confound them or it will be really hard to ask for help. Expect there is a way to do what you want to do. This will help you find commonalities and unite you with other lab members and beyond. 3.1.5 Distinguish data questions from research questions, learn how to ask for help 3.2 Open data science tools exist 3.2.1 Tools to match data science theory Wickham 2017 3.2.2 They exist to streamline working with data 3.2.3 And they are developed by actual people – nice people! 3.2.4 My advice 3.2.4.1 Expect there is a better way If you’re making the same plot 10 times, stop. Don’t confound data science with your science. Expect that someone has had your problem before or done what you want to do. 3.2.4.2 Divorce your science question from the data science question Focus on the operations for the data, not your hypothesis 3.2.4.3 Google your question (ask for help) Articulate it, and identify useful solutions Trusted urls, recent dates 3.3 Open as a way to work 3.3.1 Open science as a way to be more efficient and streamlined Not an added ask at publication to share your data It’s not only about sharing data. It’s about how you work, who you include, and the tools that you use. 3.3.2 External memory (personal and collective) Easier on/offboarding 3.3.3 Find solutions faster – learn to talk about your data 3.3.4 Build confidence – skills are transferable beyond your science 3.3.5 Be empathic and inclusive – grow a network of allies 3.4 Lab members as a team Science is collaborative. Not heads down elbows out. 3.4.1 Focus on what unites lab members, not what sets them apart 3.4.2 Think of the lab horizontally as skillsets &amp; needs instead of vertically as science bins Instead of the skills you have when you come to the lab determining how you will be able to Do Science, have shared practices in the lab and paths to onboard new people to work that way as well. 3.5 Learn with collaborators and community (redefined) Communities for learning, teaching, and mentorship. 3.5.1 Helps overcome isolation, self-taught bad practices, apprehension Stevens et al. 2018 ### Your most important collaborator is Future You Cannot emphasize this enough.

It is a delightful read, from the first opening sentences: “Spreadsheets, for all of their mundane rectangularness, have been the subject of angst and controversy for decades.… Amid this debate, spreadsheets have continued to play a significant role in researchers’ workflows. The dangers of spreadsheets are real, however – so much so that the European Spreadsheet Risks Interest Group keeps a public archive of spreadsheet ‘horror stories’…” Broman &amp; Woo share practical tips to make spreadsheets less error-prone, easier for computers to process, and easier to share. And something incredibly cool, it’s the 3rd most downloaded stats paper in the American Statistician, behind 2 papers about p-values (twitter thread). Read their paper for strategies behind their basic principles: Be consistent Write dates like YYYY-MM-DD Don’t leave any cells empty Put just one thing in a cell Organize data as a rectangle (“Tidy data”) Create a data dictionary Don’t include calculations in the raw data files Don’t use font color or highlighting as data Choose good names for things Make backups Use data validation to avoid data entry errors Save the data in plain text files 5.2 Good enough practices in scientific computing. This publication by Wilson et al. 2017 in PLoS Computational Biology follows a previous publication by Wilson et al. 2014: Best practices for scientific computing. In terms of data management recommendataion, they have 2 main themes: work towards ready-to-analyze data incrementally, documenting both the intermediate data and the process embrace the idea of “tidy data,” which can be a powerful accelerator for analysis Read their paper for strategies behind their basic principles (Box 1): Save the raw data. Ensure that raw data are backed up in more than one location. Create the data you wish to see in the world. Create analysis-friendly data. Record all the steps used to process data. Anticipate the need to use multiple tables, &amp; use a unique identifier for every record. Submit data to a reputable DOI-issuing repository so that others can access &amp; cite. The publication also covers: Software: write, organize, and share scripts and programs used in an analysis. Collaboration: make it easy for existing and new collaborators to understand &amp; contribute to a project. Project organization: organize the digital artifacts of a project to ease discovery &amp; understanding. Tracking changes: record how various components of your project change over time. Manuscripts: write manuscripts in a way that leaves an audit trail &amp; minimizes manual merging of conflicts. 5.3 Make scientific data FAIR This publication by Stall et al 2019 in Nature, says that all disciplines should follow the geosciences and demand best practice for publishing and sharing data. FAIR data means: ‘Findable’ by anyone using common search tools ‘Accessible’ so that the data and metadata can be examined ‘Interoperable’ so that comparable data can be analysed and integrated through the use of common vocabulary and formats ‘Reusable’ by others through robust metadata, provenance, usage licences “Changes in geosciences policy and practice elevate data to valuable research contributions rather than files that are shoved in as an afterthought.” Read their paper for strategies and examples behind changing the culture: There are three big changes are crucial to shift research culture across all disciplines: Make depositing open and FAIR data a priority for all. Recognize and incentivize FAIR data practices. Fund global infrastructure to support FAIR data and tools. 5.4 Tidy data for efficiency, reproducibility, &amp; collaboration By Lowndes &amp; Horst 2020, posted on the Openscapes blog: an illustrated series to tell a story about tidy data. Tidy data has been mentioned in each of the above, as a way to organize data in spreadsheets, to prepare ready-to-analyze data, and for sharing with the FAIR principles. So what is tidy data? First, a preamble: Raw data may not be stored in a tidy way “Wrangling” data into tidy structure should be done programmatically as part of the analytical process - keep the raw data raw Tidy data is a philosophy There are existing tools to help Remember that “tidying data (“data wrangling”) – up to 50–80% of a data scientist’s time\" Lohr 2014, New York Times, so it’s important to leverage these existing philosophies and tools. When we talk about organizing data to help us work in an efficient, reproducible, and collaborative way, we are talking about TIDY DATA. We mean deliberately thinking about the shape and structure of data – something that might not seem super exciting but is truly game-changing. So let’s talk about what tidy data is and why it is so empowering for your analytical life. 5.4.1 What is tidy data? Tidy data is a way to describe data that’s organized with a particular structure – a rectangular structure, where each variable has its own column, and each observation has its own row (Wickham 2014). This standard structure of tidy data led Hadley Wickham to describe it the way Leo Tolstoy describes families. Leo says “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Similarly, Hadley says “tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.” 5.4.2 Tidy data for more efficient data science Tidy data allows you to be more efficient by using existing tools deliberately built to do the things you need to do, from subsetting portions of your data to plotting maps of your study area. Using existing tools saves you from building from scratch each time you work with a new dataset (which can be time-consuming and demoralizing). And luckily, there are a lot of tools specifically built to wrangle untidy data into tidy data (for example, in the tidyr package). By being more equipped to wrangle your data into a tidy format, you can get to your analyses faster to start answering the questions you’re asking. 5.4.3 Tidy data for easier collaboration Tidy data makes it easier to collaborate because our friends can use the same tools in a familiar way. Whether thinking about collaborators as current teammates, your future self, or future teammates, organizing and sharing data in a consistent and predictable way means less adjustment, time, and effort for all. 5.4.4 Tidy data for reproducibility and reuse Tidy data also makes it easier to reproduce analyses because they are easier to understand, update, and reuse. By using tools together that all expect tidy data as inputs, you can build and iterate really powerful workflows. And, when you have additional data entries, it’s no problem to re-run your code! 5.4.5 Tidy data for the win! Once you are empowered with tools to work with tidy data generally, it opens up a whole new world of datasets that feel more approachable because you can work using familiar tools. This transferrable confidence and ability to collaborate might be the best thing about tidy data. So for more efficient, reproducible, and collaborative analyses, make friends with tidy data! 5.4.6 Learn more about tidy data: Wickham, H (2014). Tidy Data.

Most of this comes directly from Jenny Bryan &amp; Jim Hester’s awesome course What they Forgot to Teach You About R. I highly recommend reading Chapters 1-4 that go into much better detail than the notes here. Note: these are all general coding practices, not R-specific 6.1 Source files What are they and why? Code that creates objects is “source code.” Source code is essentially text files you edit in a text editor that is then executed in the console. Examples: .R, .Rmd .py .m 6.1.1 Save the source, not the workspace Save the source code; do not save the R object itself. Save your commands as a .R or .py (“script”), or .Rmd or .ipynb (“R Markdown” or “notebook”) file. It doesn’t have to be polished. Just save it! Everything that really matters should be achieved through code that you save – including objects and figures The contrast is storing them implicitly or explicitly, as part of an entire workspace, or clicking via the mouse. 6.1.2 Always start R with a blank slate Saving code is an absolute requirement for reproducibility. When you quit, do not save the workspace to an .Rdata file. When you launch, do not reload the workspace from an .Rdata file. In RStudio, set this via Tools &gt; Global Options. 6.1.3 Restart R often during development “Have you tried turning it off and then on again?” – timeless troubleshooting wisdom, applies to everything If you use RStudio, use the menu item Session &gt; Restart R Additional ways to restart development where you left off, i.e. “re-run all the code up to HERE” 6.1.4 Avoid rm(list = ls()) It’s common to see scripts begin with this object-nuking command: rm(list = ls()) This is highly suggestive of a non-reproducible workflow. The problem with rm(list = ls()) is that, given the intent, it does not go far enough. It only deletes user-created objects from the global workspace. Instead, Restart R!! 6.2 Filepaths Every saved thing gets a unique path. Your code needs to run from somewhere specific. And when it interacts with other things (data or other code), you need to tell your code where things are. The more deliberate you are about where things live, The easier it will be for you and future you The easier it will be for other people The easier it will be on another computer 6.2.1 setwd(“path/that/only/works/on/my/machine”) The chance of setwd() having the desired effect – making the file paths work – for anyone besides its author is 0%. It’s also unlikely to work for the author one or two years or computers from now. Hard-wired, absolute paths, especially when sprinkled throughout the code, make a project brittle. Such code does not travel well across time or space. 6.2.2 setwd() BUT, if you still decide to use setwd() in your scripts, you should at least be very disciplined about it: Only use setwd() at the very start of a file, i.e. in an obvious and predictable place. Always set working directory to the same thing, namely to the top-level of the project. Always build subsequent paths relative to that. 6.2.3 R users: use the here package here() identifies your project’s files, based on the current working directory at the time when the package is loaded. library(here) here() 6.3 Project oriented workflows 6.3.1 Dilemma and Solution Problem statement: We want to work on project A with the working directory set to path/to/projectA (my data analysis) and on project B with the working directory set to path/to/projectB (my teaching material). But we also want to keep code like setwd(“path/to/projectA”) out of our scripts. Solution: Solution: use an IDE that supports a project-based workflow. An integrated development environment (IDE) offers: a powerful, R-aware code editor many ways to send your code to a running R process other modern conveniences And it eliminates: temptation to develop code directly in the Console. (instead:.R!) tension between development convenience and portability of the code. 6.3.2 Organize your work into projects Here’s what I mean by “work in a project”: File system discipline: put all files related to a project in a designated folder. This applies to data, code, figures, notes, etc. Depending on project complexity, you might enforce further organization into subfolders. Working directory intentionality: when working on project A, make sure working directory is set to project A’s folder. Ideally, this is achieved via the development workflow and tooling, not by baking absolute paths into the code. File path discipline: all paths are relative — relative to the project’s folder. Synergistic habits: you’ll get the biggest payoff if you practice all of them together. Portability: the project can be moved around on your computer or onto other computers and will still “just work.” is the only practical convention that creates reliable, polite behavior across different computers/users/time. This convention is neither new, nor unique to R. It’s like agreeing that we will all drive on the left or the right. A hallmark of civilization is following conventions that constrain your behavior a little, in the name of public safety. 6.3.3 RStudio Projects The RStudio IDE has a notion of a (capital “P”) Project, which is a very effective implementation of (small “p”) projects. Project have an.Rproj file in the folder, which is used to store settings specific to that project. Use File &gt; New Project … to get started. Allows for multiple projects no danger of crosstalk: each has own R process, global workspace &amp; working directory Same “unit” as a GitHub repo! 6.3.4 Tips for RStudio Projects One suggestion for organizing: Have a dedicated folder for your Projects. - If you have One Main Place for Projects, then go there in Finder/File Explorer to launch any specific project with .Rproj. - Mine is called “~/github/.” Switching Projects: RStudio knows about recent Projects. 6.3.5 Name files deliberately Jenny Bryan’s 3 rules for Naming Things: machine readable human readable plays well with default ordering Available from Speakerdeck or download pdf 6.4 Further reading https://jhudatascience.org/tidyversecourse/ https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008770 "],["team-culture.html", "Chapter 7 Team culture 7.1 Why talk about team culture? 7.2 Deliberately setting the tone 7.3 Collegiality 7.4 Lab efficiency 7.5 Enabling &amp; participating 7.6 Post Cohort Call Resources 7.7 Further reading", " Chapter 7 Team culture 7.1 Why talk about team culture?

We will focus on how to use GitHub for collaboration and communication for science, and spend time with hands-on practice. We are going to work with GitHub from the browser only, because it makes the best use of our short time together. It is also a powerful way for folks to contribute and collaborate even if they are not involved in day-to-day hands-on analysis. So this might be good for new lab members or students to contribute to your lab as soon as possible. GitHub can reduce friction for open science: it gives us avenues for communicating and publishing methods, blogs, interactive graphics and more, without a lot of heavy lifting! 9.1.1 Prerequisite You will need to create GitHub account at http://github.com, if you don’t already have one. For username, I recommend all lower-case letters, short as you can. I recommend using your .edu email, since you can request free private repositories via GitHub Education discount. 9.2 What is GitHub? — Traditional answer GitHub means GitHub.com; it’s a company that is an online collaborative platform, with some features familiar to social media users. GitHub centers around git, which is powerful version control software for your local computer. This has been around for years, taking care of bookkeeping for you locally on your computer. GitHub makes git’s local bookkeeping collaborative through its powerful online platform. It will weave together all the version control from your local computer with other collaborators you work with. It is used for code and files: organize, archive, bookkeeping, searchable, changes visualized, etc. In the figure below, notice the familiar red and green to denote deletions and additions line-by-line, with darker shading to identify specific text within a line. Also notice the differencing in the image’s color bar! We aren’t going to teach traditional git/GitHub today, but here are some recommendations if you’d like to learn. First, read Jenny Bryan’s “Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?” (open-access pre-print from PeerJ, published in The American Statistican). This provides an excellent overview. One quote I like in particular is Collaboration is the most compelling reason to manage a project with Git and GitHub. My definition of collaboration includes hands-on participation by multiple people, including your past and future self, as well as an asymmetric model, in which some people are active makers and others only read or review. - Jenny Bryan, “Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?” Next, to learn GitHub with R, the absolute best resource is Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git With R. This is a comprehensive, friendly step-by-step process of how to do so, and is an awesome reference for seasoned git/GitHub users as well. If you want a shorter-form resource, I’d recommend 2 tutorials from OHI-Science’s data-science-training. This also teaches you how to set up GitHub to sync directly through RStudio, so that you don’t have to have any other software (including the command line) open to do so: GitHub Collaborating with GitHub On my local computer, I interact with GitHub through RStudio 99.9% of the time (use command line .1% of time). Upcoming: resources for setting up GitHub without RStudio 9.3 What is GitHub? — Non-traditional answer 9.3.1 Publishing platform It’s for books like this one (openscapes.org/series), websites like openscapes.org, which was built with R’s blogdown package, and interactive dashboards. 9.3.2 Project management system GitHub is also a project management system for short and long-term tasks. It is really powerful to have collaborative “todo”’s in the same software (and user accounts) as all the analysis and all the people that you’re already working with. We will talk about “Issues” &amp; “Projects” in the next chapter. 9.4 GitHub framework in a nutshell 9.4.1 Users vs. organizations Example: jules32 is a user account, openscapes is an organization group. You can think of them like other social media accounts: I can be an individual or part of a group, and there are permissions associated with both. 9.4.2 Repositories (“repos”) Repos are GitHub’s main unit. They are essentially a folder, and you’ll put files and folders in them. They are contained, with permissions specific to each one. It makes it easier to navigate through and find stuff — so you are “not sifting through a zoo of files” as one Openscapes Champion has said. 9.4.3 “Commits” &amp; “commit messages” Unlike Dropbox or Google Drive that constantly and automatically sync to the cloud, you have to deliberately tell git/GitHub when you have an amount of work that you want to be versioned and synced. You have to commit to telling them. GitHub takes care of the backend bookkeeping involved, but you have to write a human-readable message to your future self and others. That is the commit message. There is no absolute guidance for how often to commit, but I think of it as leaving breadcrumbs for yourself. How much work and on what things/in what combination would you like to be able to reverse? What kind of information will make it easier for Future You to work with? 9.4.4 Public vs private You can have both public (the free default) and private repositories, and change these permissions later on. I mostly work in public repos, but if I work in private ones, I often have the expectation that they will be made public some day. So I practice good habits with commits and documentation, and keep conversations on-topic. 9.4.5 The search feature is awesome You are able to search within a GitHub repository, across repositories in an organization, or across all GitHub public repositories. I find this helps me find things quickly if I’m looking for how I’ve used a function in the past, or if I remember a word that would stand out that I included in a commit message as a breadcrumb to myself. It will also search Issues within the repositories, so you can look for specific words in conversations as well. 9.4.6 Branches &amp; Forks We’re not going to talk about branches and forks. These are a core feature of what makes GitHub super powerful for software development, and one of the first things you’ll see in GitHub tutorials geared towards software engineers. But I do not think that is the most relevant or smoothest entryway for those of us who are scientists fairly new to collaborative coding and version control. 9.5 GitHub Orientation This is a demo details upcoming knitr::include_graphics(&quot;img/github-orientation.png&quot;) 9.6 Editing files from GitHub. This is also a demo details upcoming First a Disclaimer: you don’t want to edit from the browser for most things – you would want to “clone” the repo to your local computer and leverage more goodies &amp; power. However, you will sometimes edit in the browser, and it’s a good entry point for us today, and maybe for onboarding folks in your lab in the future. Why not edit in the browser? You don’t want to overwrite each other or forget yourself. Good for quick md editing, not script editing. In the demo, the example .md was a deliberate example of sharing slides from a talk :) What to do: (you all have permissions) Go to https://github.com/openscapes/demo/yourname.md Click on the pencil to edit your file Make many edits &amp; commits with commit messages github.com has a default message, but get into the habit of writing an actual message to yourself/others (breadcrumbs) This is different from saving (cancel if you save!) "],["github-issues.html", "Chapter 10 GitHub for Project Management 10.1 Preamble 10.2 What are Issues? 10.3 Issues in the Wild 10.4 How to use Issues 10.5 Strategies for Issues 10.6 Your Turn: Create &amp; comment on issues", " Chapter 10 GitHub for Project Management 10.1 Preamble GitHub is best known as a collaborative coding platform. But of course productive collaboration requires communication, and GitHub has powerful features to support communication and project management through GitHub Issues. (Also see thee previous chapter about GitHub for publishing). We are focusing on GitHub Issues here because they are a powerful way for team members to have active discussions about data and code, and therefore ways to participate in analyses even for those that are not involved in the day-to-day coding. I find Issues not only useful to discuss topics as a team, but I also treat it as my external memory: I write notes to myself, link to files and websites; I leave breadcrumbs for myself so that I am more easily able to remember my past thought processes and pick up projects where I left off. In this way, GitHub Issues help actualize the mindset of Future You and Future Us. This means being deliberate now about communicating decisions and progress so that you or others can work in the future a little more smoothly. Using project management software is a strategy used by every software developer or people working on projects with many moving parts. It streamlines technical discussions with people who are coming/joining a group. It also helps organize and track projects that single or multiple &amp; overlapping users can be a part of. While there are many options for project management software out there, I like using GitHub because it’s already managing my code and my work, and linked to my collaborators so it offers a streamlined way to communicate. It’s also one less account I need to have, which is a huge bonus in my mind. One of the reason we talk about Issues in Openscapes is because they are an excellent way to develop habits for using GitHub for your analytical project more broadly. 10.2 What are Issues? Every GitHub repository (shortened to “repo”) has a feature called Issues. Issues is GitHub’s project management and task-tracking feature. Issues “track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.” - GitHub Jenny Bryan has an excellent summary of Issues in her article “Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?” (open-access pre-print from PeerJ, published in The American Statistican): GitHub issues are another powerful feature of the platform. Recall that we are repur- posing Git, a tool that facilitates software development. Think of the issues for a project as its bug tracker. For projects that are not pure software development, we co-opt this machinery to organize our to-do list more generally. The basic unit is an issue and you can interact with one in two ways. First, issues are integrated into the project’s web interface on GitHub, with a rich set of options for linking to project files and incremental changes. Second, issues and their associated comment threads appear in your email, just like regular messages (this can, of course, be configured). The result is that all correspondence about a project comes through your normal channels, but is also tracked inside the project itself, with excellent navigability and search capabilities. For software, issues are used to track bugs and feature requests. In a data analysis project, you might open an issue to flesh out a specific sub-analysis or to develop a complicated figure. In a course, we use them to manage homework submission, marking, and peer review. Issues can be assigned to specific people and they can be labelled, e.g. “bug,” “simulation- study,” or “final-exam.” Coupled with the ability to cross-link issues and the project files or file changes, you have extraordinary power to document why things have happened in the past and to organize what needs to happen in the future. You create an Issue for a topic, and use it track progress or ask questions. You can provide links, describe updates, link to other Issues, and you can close the Issue when it is completed. You can also re-open previously-closed Issues. Every GitHub repository has this Issues feature. This means that sometimes Issues are public and sometimes they are private. In a public repo, anyone with a GitHub username can create and comment on issues. In a private repo, only users with permission can create and comment on issues, or see them at all GitHub search is awesome – it will search all of your files and Issues! 10.3 Issues in the Wild Here are some examples of “traditional” and “non-traditional” use of issues. ggplot2’s Issues is an example of what I think is the “traditional” use of Issues, which is in a pretty pure software development context. This is a public repository, and all topics are directly related to ggplot2. Issues are largely used to report bugs, troubleshoot and sometimes to request features. Note the “Filters” feature on the top-left: this by default will search through the Issues that are still open, but you can also change this if you wanted to search also for closed Issues (just below “Filters” you can see that there are over 2000 closed Issues, documenting the innovation that’s been ongoing in ggplot2). MozillaFestival’s Issues are an example of a less “traditional,” but increasingly common use of Issues: for project submissions, coordination, and community engagement. It is also an example of the use of labels: those colorful tags that help group and categorize the Issues. To the right of “Filters,” you’ll see a “Labels” button: clicking on this will give you a list of all the labels and how many Issues are tagged with each label. OHI-Science’s Issues: are also an example of less “traditional” use of Issues but perhaps also somewhat common. This is a private repository, which is why there is no link to these Issues. Here, Issues are used for private conversations and archiving ideas and discussions: the OHI-Science team uses issues instead of email to have private, archived, searchable conversations about scientific methods. We are diligent about having important science conversations in these Issues, rather than those conversations being lost in emails or Slack. This is more organized and also makes onboarding team members much smoother since we do not need to forward emails to new team members. 10.4 How to use Issues Let’s do a demo with Issues. 10.4.1 Creating a new Issue When you click on the green “New Issue” button\", you’re asked to give a Title and Leave a Comment. You can also attach files or images by dragging them into the Issue. Then you’ll be able to Submit the Issue. On the right side, you’ll see options to Assign someone to the Issue, add a Label, add it to a Project, or add it to a Milestone. We’ll explore these features a bit more in a moment. When you click Submit, your Issue gets a number, which is now written next to the title. This number is also part of the URL as well. On the right of the Title, note that there is an “Edit” button if you ever need to change the title of the Issue as the conversation evolves. The Issue number will stay the same. What happens if you want to edit the text of your Comment after you’ve Submitted it? No problem. See that once you’ve submitted an Issue, there is a blue bar at the top of the Comment, attributing your username to this comment along with the date. At the very right of this blue bar, there are 3 dots. Clicking here will give you the option to edit. 10.4.2 Commenting The great thing about Issues is that they are for conversations with yourself and others. So once you’ve submitted an Issue, you can string together additional Comments within this comment. Maybe you asked a question, and someone else will respond with a solution or idea. They might link to an Issue with a related topic, or an external link that might be helpful. You can also tag people in Issue Comments with the “@” symbol. As noted above, anyone who is part of the repository will automatically get email notifications when comments are submitted. But tagging specific users will also send them an email, and is a good way to bring folks into the conversation who might not already be “watching” the whole repository. In a public repository you can tag any GitHub user, and in a private repository they have to have permission. Each time there is a comment in the Issue thread, there will be a new date marked in the blue bar at the top of the Issue. This is a nice way to see how current conversations are. And something really great is that you can click on the date — and watch the URL change. This allows you to anchor to a specific comment within the Issue thread. This is really useful if, for example, you wanted to share a specific comment with someone else instead of having them scroll down themselves. (Note: you can also click on the three dots at the right of the blue Comment header to copy the anchored link). 10.4.3 Markdown Issues support Markdown. This means that you can add simple formatting to your text, such as headers, bold and italics, lists, images, links, and formatted code. To help you use Markdown formatting as you learn, GitHub Issues have built-in help: there are icons between the Title and the Comment of the Issue that will do the Markdown formatting for you, and help you learn along the way. There is also a “Preview” tab between the Title and Comment (next to the “Write” tab, where you are by default) where you can preview what your Markdown formatting looks like before you Submit the Issue. Submitting the Issue will also render the Markdown formatting. GitHub enables you to also create Markdown check-lists by typing - [ ]. Once this is rendered, you can click it to check this box. Alternatively, in Markdown you check a box by typing - [x]. The number of checked and unchecked items will be visible in the Issue as well. 10.4.4 Linking to files Linking to specific files or versions of files is good practice when you are discussing it in an Issue: reduce the work for the person reading the Issue (which might be Future You!). You can link to the file by opening it in the browser and copying its URL and placing it in Markdown formatting for hyperlinks: [text to hyperlink](URL). You can also navigate to a specific version of that file, or a specific commit message, if you want to capture that file at a specific point in time. You can also anchor to specific lines within a file, which is useful if you are requesting feedback on a specific part of an analysis or asking for help troubleshooting. I can send someone to a specific place within a file with the appropriate lines highlighted. For example [important code](https://github.com/Openscapes/issues-demo/blob/master/code-example.R#L12-L13) will render as important code. 10.4.5 Assigning, Labels On the right side of the Issue thread, there is the “metadata” for the Issue. You can assign the Issue to a specific user, or label it with a suite of labels that you can customize (when you click on labels, see all the way at the bottom the option to edit labels. And there are other ways to navigate there as well). If you navigate back to the full list of Issue topics (which will have the URL github.com/username-or-organization/repo-name/issues), you’ll see these metadata categories listed at the top as well, which lets you filter or view based on these categories. 10.4.6 Projects, Milestones Projects and Milestones are further ways to organize and track progress with your Issues. Projects are a way to organize and prioritize your issues. It uses the idea of a Kanban board, which Wikipedia says “visually depict work at various stages of a process using cards to represent work items and columns to represent each stage of the process. Cards are moved from left to right to show progress and to help coordinate teams performing the work.” The simplest have 3 columns labeled “to do,” “doing” and “done.” You can use Projects for both Organization or personal projects. In fact, you can have multiple projects within the same repository, so different people can have different Projects organized within their shared repository, for example. You have a lot of control over how you will manage your Projects; at this point I do not use all the features but have been playing around with using them for Openscapes planning: Milestones are a way to attach deadlines to your Project (although you do not need to identify a date if you don’t want to). Once you create a Milestone, you can add Issues to that Milestone to help track progress. For example, maybe you have a presentation coming up and there are several Issues that need to be addressed before then. 10.5 Strategies for Issues Every repo has Issues, but do you want to use Issues in every repo? It helps to consider the purpose for the Issues. Using Issues for “traditional” bug/features for code, it makes sense to keep the repository public and have all Issues pertaining to that repo there within that repo. If you’re using Issues for “non-traditional” laboratory research group and science conversations, there are other considerations. Maybe you do want a private repository, but even so you’ll want to think ahead. Will you eventually make that repo public when you publish your study? Changing a repo from private to public (or vice versa, both are possible in the repository’s Settings) will make not only the code and files of that repo public, but also all the Issues. Which is fine, but it might add considerations in terms of what is discussed in those Issues. 10.5.1 OHI example Here is an example of the Ocean Health Index team’s thought process &amp; strategy. Our team works within a GitHub Organization called “OHI-Science.” Within that Organization, we work in many repositories, with different combinations of people working primarily within different repositories. Sanity-wise, we didn’t want to have conversations in Issues within each of those repositories because it would make finding those conversations more difficult (although now GitHub can search all Issues/code across an Organization!). We also wanted our repos to be public, but to have private conversations using the Issues feature. These two needs led us to create a single private repository named “issues,” and we only use it for Issues. This works really well for us, especially since our team lead can engage in these discussions by receiving emails about the Issues in his inbox, and can respond without having to go to GitHub.com. 10.6 Your Turn: Create &amp; comment on issues We will break into groups and you can explore some of these features in Issues. Here is what to do: Go to github.com/openscapes/demo/issues Create an issue, tag people in your breakout group (ask for their username) Browse issues, comment in other issues Try: Linking to the .md document you created in the previous chapter Creating a label and applying it, assigning people Adding Issues to a Project (create one if need be) Closing an Issue Have fun! And throughout the process, talk to your breakout group, and share what you learn. Here’s what your inbox will look like afterwards: This is pretty rare to receive so many emails all at once. But you can always switch your setting to “Not Watch” this repository so that you only receive emails about Issues that you are tagged in.
