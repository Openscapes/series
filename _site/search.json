    "text": "What to expect\n\nThis is going to be fun and empowering!\nWe are going to be discussing a wide range of topics and working to seed habits for you to engage and learn with them with our lab and others on campus.\n\n\nExposure to relevant tools & practices, confidence & agency to engage, community to learn with\nThe plan is to expose you to a lot of great tools and practices that you can have confidence using in your research. We will also spend time helping you plan how to actually incrementally weave them into your existing workflows.\nThe point is not to overwhelm you or make you feel like it’s too late for you or that you would need to throw out and redo everything you’ve ever done in order to take the first step. No. By seeing what’s possible and how shared practices can make your own life easier, and life easier and more streamlined and fun with your lab and beyond, you’ll start experimenting with these practices and in a few years you will be working in a completely different way.\n\n\nCreate a shared culture – in your lab, on campus, and beyond\nWe’re going to go through a lot and it’s less important that you remember it all. More importantly, you’ll know what is possible, have confidence that you can do it, and have allies so you’re not alone. The main thing to take away is that there are good ways to approach your analyses; we will teach you to expect that so you can find what you need and use it! A theme throughout is that tools exist and are being developed by real, and extraordinarily nice, people to meet you where you are and help you do what you need to do. If you expect and appreciate that, you will be more efficient in doing your awesome science.\n\n\nNo skills required. We will strategize about general approaches, specific examples using R/RStudio and GitHub\nThere are no skills required to participate, and we will not be teaching hands-on how to code or set up databases. But we will be talking about how these are important and fit together in the big picture, and how to get started learning the skills you need. This is an opportunity to discuss existing tools and how to engage, meet other labs, discuss next steps, and stay accountable.\nWe’ll talk about tools and practices broadly, but also with specific examples using R and GitHub. Won’t that software eventually become outdated you say — is it worth learning them over something else? The answer is yes, software will change and become outdated; it always has. But seeing what is possible and becoming versed in embracing existing architecture and practices will set you up to make whatever transition comes, and you will make this transition with the community, not along. Your skills will be transferrable skills as the actual software changes. Analogy: if you learn one musical instrument, you will be able to learn another one more fluidly than if you have never learned one to begin with because maybe you can read music, understand something about timing and rhythm, etc.\n\n\nEveryone is coming with different experiences & expectations\nEveryone in this workshop is coming from a different place with different experiences and expectations. But everyone will learn something new here, because there is so much innovation in the data science world. You are encouraged to ask questions and answer those of others.\n\n\nWe are all learning together\nThese tools are new to all of us, and the best ideas come from questions from anyone. If you are already familiar with some of this material, think about how your experience was learning it, and how you might teach it to others. Use these workshop materials not only as a reference in the future but also for talking points so you can communicate the importance of these tools to your communities. A big part of this Series is not only for you to learn these skills, but for you to also teach others and increase the value and practice of open data science in science as a whole.\n\n\nVulnerability: yes! Shame: no.\nShame is not allowed here. No “I’m 34 and haven’t learned GitHub, it’s too late for me” or any of that. We have never had the opportunity to learn these things, there should be no shame on your part for that. It takes a lot of time and dedicated effort to learn and employ these practices, and they should be valued and taught. That’s why you’re here now, you should be proud that you are taking the initiative and your time to do this. No shame.\nVulnerability, however, will be involved in this Series. Vulnerability is a big part of learning and trying new things — this is a safe place for everyone to learn. Vulnerability is taking stock of where you are now and help you map out where you want to be. Being vulnerable is scary. But it shouldn’t be lonely: we all have data confessions that would love to talk about and get help with, if only our scientific culture said that was OK; if only we knew how to articulate our questions and have someone to ask. This is a place to share our vulnerabilities to ignite real change. Ask questions. Whether it’s a keyboard shortcut or philosophy of data workflows, ask and let’s talk about it.\n\n\n\nEveryone is welcome here\nYou are all welcome here, please be respectful of one another. We are setting a tone of mutual respect and a space place for learning where we assume good intentions and interact with kindness and empathy. Pass it on."

    "text": "Preamble\n\nWe are focusing on GitHub Issues here because they are a powerful way for team members to have active discussions about data and code, and therefore ways to participate in analyses even for those that are not involved in the day-to-day coding. I find Issues not only useful to discuss topics as a team, but I also treat it as my external memory: I write notes to myself, link to files and websites; I leave breadcrumbs for myself so that I am more easily able to remember my past thought processes and pick up projects where I left off.\nIn this way, GitHub Issues help actualize the mindset of Future You and Future Us. This means being deliberate now about communicating decisions and progress so that you or others can work in the future a little more smoothly. Using project management software is a strategy used by every software developer or people working on projects with many moving parts. It streamlines technical discussions with people who are coming/joining a group. It also helps organize and track projects that single or multiple & overlapping users can be a part of.\nWhile there are many options for project management software out there, I like using GitHub because it’s already managing my code and my work, and linked to my collaborators so it offers a streamlined way to communicate. It’s also one less account I need to have, which is a huge bonus in my mind.\nOne of the reason we talk about Issues in Openscapes is because they are an excellent way to develop habits for using GitHub for your analytical project more broadly."

    "text": "What are Issues?\nEvery GitHub repository (shortened to “repo”) has a feature called Issues. Issues is GitHub’s project management and task-tracking feature.\n\nIssues “track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.” - GitHub\n\n\n\n\n\nJenny Bryan has an excellent summary of Issues in her article “Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?” (open-access pre-print from PeerJ, published in The American Statistican):\n\nGitHub issues are another powerful feature of the platform. Recall that we are repur- posing Git, a tool that facilitates software development. Think of the issues for a project as its bug tracker. For projects that are not pure software development, we co-opt this machinery to organize our to-do list more generally. The basic unit is an issue and you can interact with one in two ways.\n\n\nFirst, issues are integrated into the project’s web interface on GitHub, with a rich set of options for linking to project files and incremental changes. Second, issues and their associated comment threads appear in your email, just like regular messages (this can, of course, be configured). The result is that all correspondence about a project comes through your normal channels, but is also tracked inside the project itself, with excellent navigability and search capabilities. For software, issues are used to track bugs and feature requests. In a data analysis project, you might open an issue to flesh out a specific sub-analysis or to develop a complicated figure. In a course, we use them to manage homework submission, marking, and peer review.\n\n\nIssues can be assigned to specific people and they can be labelled, e.g. “bug”, “simulation- study”, or “final-exam”. Coupled with the ability to cross-link issues and the project files or file changes, you have extraordinary power to document why things have happened in the past and to organize what needs to happen in the future.\n\n\nYou create an Issue for a topic, and use it track progress or ask questions. You can provide links, describe updates, link to other Issues, and you can close the Issue when it is completed. You can also re-open previously-closed Issues.\nEvery GitHub repository has this Issues feature. This means that sometimes Issues are public and sometimes they are private.\n\nIn a public repo, anyone with a GitHub username can create and comment on issues.\nIn a private repo, only users with permission can create and comment on issues, or see them at all\n\nGitHub search is awesome – it will search all of your files and Issues!"

    "text": "Issues in the Wild\nHere are some examples of “traditional” and “non-traditional” use of issues.\nggplot2’s Issues is an example of what I think is the “traditional” use of Issues, which is in a pretty pure software development context. This is a public repository, and all topics are directly related to ggplot2. Issues are largely used to report bugs, troubleshoot and sometimes to request features. Note the “Filters” feature on the top-left: this by default will search through the Issues that are still open, but you can also change this if you wanted to search also for closed Issues (just below “Filters” you can see that there are over 2000 closed Issues, documenting the innovation that’s been ongoing in ggplot2).\n\n\n\nMozillaFestival’s Issues are an example of a less “traditional”, but increasingly common use of Issues: for project submissions, coordination, and community engagement. It is also an example of the use of labels: those colorful tags that help group and categorize the Issues. To the right of “Filters”, you’ll see a “Labels” button: clicking on this will give you a list of all the labels and how many Issues are tagged with each label.\n\n\n\nOHI-Science’s Issues: are also an example of less “traditional” use of Issues but perhaps also somewhat common. This is a private repository, which is why there is no link to these Issues. Here, Issues are used for private conversations and archiving ideas and discussions: the OHI-Science team uses issues instead of email to have private, archived, searchable conversations about scientific methods. We are diligent about having important science conversations in these Issues, rather than those conversations being lost in emails or Slack. This is more organized and also makes onboarding team members much smoother since we do not need to forward emails to new team members."

    "text": "How to use Issues\nLet’s do a demo with Issues.\n\nCreating a new Issue\nWhen you click on the green “New Issue” button”, you’re asked to give a Title and Leave a Comment. You can also attach files or images by dragging them into the Issue.\nThen you’ll be able to Submit the Issue. On the right side, you’ll see options to Assign someone to the Issue, add a Label, add it to a Project, or add it to a Milestone. We’ll explore these features a bit more in a moment.\n\n\n\nWhen you click Submit, your Issue gets a number, which is now written next to the title. This number is also part of the URL as well.\nOn the right of the Title, note that there is an “Edit” button if you ever need to change the title of the Issue as the conversation evolves. The Issue number will stay the same.\nWhat happens if you want to edit the text of your Comment after you’ve Submitted it? No problem. See that once you’ve submitted an Issue, there is a blue bar at the top of the Comment, attributing your username to this comment along with the date. At the very right of this blue bar, there are 3 dots. Clicking here will give you the option to edit.\n\n\nCommenting\nThe great thing about Issues is that they are for conversations with yourself and others. So once you’ve submitted an Issue, you can string together additional Comments within this comment. Maybe you asked a question, and someone else will respond with a solution or idea. They might link to an Issue with a related topic, or an external link that might be helpful.\nYou can also tag people in Issue Comments with the “@” symbol. As noted above, anyone who is part of the repository will automatically get email notifications when comments are submitted. But tagging specific users will also send them an email, and is a good way to bring folks into the conversation who might not already be “watching” the whole repository. In a public repository you can tag any GitHub user, and in a private repository they have to have permission.\nEach time there is a comment in the Issue thread, there will be a new date marked in the blue bar at the top of the Issue. This is a nice way to see how current conversations are.\nAnd something really great is that you can click on the date — and watch the URL change. This allows you to anchor to a specific comment within the Issue thread. This is really useful if, for example, you wanted to share a specific comment with someone else instead of having them scroll down themselves. (Note: you can also click on the three dots at the right of the blue Comment header to copy the anchored link).\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown\nIssues support Markdown. This means that you can add simple formatting to your text, such as headers, bold and italics, lists, images, links, and formatted code. To help you use Markdown formatting as you learn, GitHub Issues have built-in help: there are icons between the Title and the Comment of the Issue that will do the Markdown formatting for you, and help you learn along the way.\nThere is also a “Preview” tab between the Title and Comment (next to the “Write” tab, where you are by default) where you can preview what your Markdown formatting looks like before you Submit the Issue. Submitting the Issue will also render the Markdown formatting.\nGitHub enables you to also create Markdown check-lists by typing - [ ]. Once this is rendered, you can click it to check this box. Alternatively, in Markdown you check a box by typing - [x]. The number of checked and unchecked items will be visible in the Issue as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nLinking to files\nLinking to specific files or versions of files is good practice when you are discussing it in an Issue: reduce the work for the person reading the Issue (which might be Future You!). You can link to the file by opening it in the browser and copying its URL and placing it in Markdown formatting for hyperlinks: [text to hyperlink](URL).\nYou can also navigate to a specific version of that file, or a specific commit message, if you want to capture that file at a specific point in time.\nYou can also anchor to specific lines within a file, which is useful if you are requesting feedback on a specific part of an analysis or asking for help troubleshooting. I can send someone to a specific place within a file with the appropriate lines highlighted. For example [important code](https://github.com/Openscapes/issues-demo/blob/master/code-example.R#L12-L13) will render as important code.\n\n \n\n\nAssigning, Labels\nOn the right side of the Issue thread, there is the “metadata” for the Issue. You can assign the Issue to a specific user, or label it with a suite of labels that you can customize (when you click on labels, see all the way at the bottom the option to edit labels. And there are other ways to navigate there as well).\nIf you navigate back to the full list of Issue topics (which will have the URL github.com/username-or-organization/repo-name/issues), you’ll see these metadata categories listed at the top as well, which lets you filter or view based on these categories.\n\n \n\n\nProjects, Milestones\nProjects and Milestones are further ways to organize and track progress with your Issues.\nProjects are a way to organize and prioritize your issues. It uses the idea of a Kanban board, which Wikipedia says “visually depict work at various stages of a process using cards to represent work items and columns to represent each stage of the process. Cards are moved from left to right to show progress and to help coordinate teams performing the work.” The simplest have 3 columns labeled “to do”, “doing” and “done”.\nYou can use Projects for both Organization or personal projects. In fact, you can have multiple projects within the same repository, so different people can have different Projects organized within their shared repository, for example.\nYou have a lot of control over how you will manage your Projects; at this point I do not use all the features but have been playing around with using them for Openscapes planning:\n\n\n\nMilestones are a way to attach deadlines to your Project (although you do not need to identify a date if you don’t want to). Once you create a Milestone, you can add Issues to that Milestone to help track progress. For example, maybe you have a presentation coming up and there are several Issues that need to be addressed before then."

    "text": "Strategies for Issues\n\nEvery repo has Issues, but do you want to use Issues in every repo? It helps to consider the purpose for the Issues.\nUsing Issues for “traditional” bug/features for code, it makes sense to keep the repository public and have all Issues pertaining to that repo there within that repo.\nIf you’re using Issues for “non-traditional” laboratory research group and science conversations, there are other considerations. Maybe you do want a private repository, but even so you’ll want to think ahead. Will you eventually make that repo public when you publish your study? Changing a repo from private to public (or vice versa, both are possible in the repository’s Settings) will make not only the code and files of that repo public, but also all the Issues. Which is fine, but it might add considerations in terms of what is discussed in those Issues.\n\nOHI example\nHere is an example of the Ocean Health Index team’s thought process & strategy.\nOur team works within a GitHub Organization called “OHI-Science”. Within that Organization, we work in many repositories, with different combinations of people working primarily within different repositories. Sanity-wise, we didn’t want to have conversations in Issues within each of those repositories because it would make finding those conversations more difficult (although now GitHub can search all Issues/code across an Organization!).\nWe also wanted our repos to be public, but to have private conversations using the Issues feature.\nThese two needs led us to create a single private repository named “issues”, and we only use it for Issues. This works really well for us, especially since our team lead can engage in these discussions by receiving emails about the Issues in his inbox, and can respond without having to go to GitHub.com."

This can both reduce friction and reinventing the wheel. But there also needs to be room for different skills people come in with. For example, if they’re more efficient in Python, don’t want to force R. But want to create space where folks can interoperate and work together. The tech/software side helps with this, but it’s our mindsets too. We need to be open to it."

    "text": "Tidy data for efficiency, reproducibility, & collaboration\nBy Lowndes & Horst 2020, posted on the Openscapes blog: an illustrated series to tell a story about tidy data.\nTidy data has been mentioned in each of the above, as a way to organize data in spreadsheets, to prepare ready-to-analyze data, and for sharing with the FAIR principles.\nSo what is tidy data?\nFirst, a preamble:\n\nRaw data may not be stored in a tidy way\n“Wrangling” data into tidy structure should be done programmatically as part of the analytical process - keep the raw data raw\nTidy data is a philosophy\nThere are existing tools to help\n\nRemember that “tidying data (“data wrangling”) – up to 50–80% of a data scientist’s time” Lohr 2014, New York Times, so it’s important to leverage these existing philosophies and tools.\nWhen we talk about organizing data to help us work in an efficient, reproducible, and collaborative way, we are talking about TIDY DATA. We mean deliberately thinking about the shape and structure of data – something that might not seem super exciting but is truly game-changing.\nSo let’s talk about what tidy data is and why it is so empowering for your analytical life.\n\nWhat is tidy data?\nTidy data is a way to describe data that’s organized with a particular structure – a rectangular structure, where each variable has its own column, and each observation has its own row (Wickham 2014).\n\n\n\n\nThis standard structure of tidy data led Hadley Wickham to describe it the way Leo Tolstoy describes families. Leo says “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way”. Similarly, Hadley says “tidy datasets are all alike, but every messy dataset is messy in its own way”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy data for more efficient data science\nTidy data allows you to be more efficient by using existing tools deliberately built to do the things you need to do, from subsetting portions of your data to plotting maps of your study area. Using existing tools saves you from building from scratch each time you work with a new dataset (which can be time-consuming and demoralizing). And luckily, there are a lot of tools specifically built to wrangle untidy data into tidy data (for example, in the tidyr package). By being more equipped to wrangle your data into a tidy format, you can get to your analyses faster to start answering the questions you’re asking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy data for easier collaboration\nTidy data makes it easier to collaborate because our friends can use the same tools in a familiar way. Whether thinking about collaborators as current teammates, your future self, or future teammates, organizing and sharing data in a consistent and predictable way means less adjustment, time, and effort for all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy data for reproducibility and reuse\nTidy data also makes it easier to reproduce analyses because they are easier to understand, update, and reuse. By using tools together that all expect tidy data as inputs, you can build and iterate really powerful workflows. And, when you have additional data entries, it’s no problem to re-run your code!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTidy data for the win!\nOnce you are empowered with tools to work with tidy data generally, it opens up a whole new world of datasets that feel more approachable because you can work using familiar tools. This transferrable confidence and ability to collaborate might be the best thing about tidy data.\n\n\n\n\nSo for more efficient, reproducible, and collaborative analyses, make friends with tidy data!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about tidy data:"

Source code is essentially text files you edit in a text editor that is then executed in the console.\nExamples:\n\n.R, .Rmd\n.py\n.m\n\n\nSave the source, not the workspace\nSave the source code; do not save the R object itself.\nSave your commands as “scripts” (.R, .py) or “notebooks” (.Rmd, ipynb). It doesn’t have to be polished. Just save it!\nEverything that really matters should be achieved through code that you save – including objects and figures The contrast is storing them implicitly or explicitly, as part of an entire workspace, or clicking via the mouse.\nLoad libraries/packages at the top. Just like a recipe: tell us the ingredients need before we get going!\n\n\nAlways start R with a blank slate\nSaving code is an absolute requirement for reproducibility.\nWhen you quit, do not save the workspace to an .Rdata file. When you launch, do not reload the workspace from an .Rdata file.\nIn RStudio, set this via Tools > Global Options.\n\n\nRestart R often during development\n\n“Have you tried turning it off and then on again?” – timeless troubleshooting wisdom, applies to everything\n\nIf you use RStudio, use the menu item Session > Restart R\nAdditional ways to restart development where you left off, i.e. “re-run all the code up to HERE”\n\n\nAvoid rm(list = ls())\nIt’s common to see scripts begin with this object-nuking command: rm(list = ls())\nThis is highly suggestive of a non-reproducible workflow.\nThe problem with rm(list = ls()) is that, given the intent, it does not go far enough.\nIt only deletes user-created objects from the global workspace.\nInstead, Restart R with a clean slate OFTEN (e.g. many times/day), and write every script assuming it will be run in a fresh R process"

This convention is neither new, nor unique to R.\nIt’s like agreeing that we will all drive on the left or the right. A hallmark of civilization is following conventions that constrain your behavior a little, in the name of public safety.\n\n\nRStudio Projects\nThe RStudio IDE has a notion of a (capital “P”) Project, which is a very effective implementation of (small “p”) projects.\nProject have an.Rproj file in the folder, which is used to store settings specific to that project.

    "section": "What is GitHub? — Traditional answer",
    "text": "What is GitHub? — Traditional answer\nGitHub means GitHub.com; it’s a company that is an online collaborative platform, with some features familiar to social media users.\nGitHub centers around git, which is powerful version control software for your local computer. This has been around for years, taking care of bookkeeping for you locally on your computer.\nGitHub makes git’s local bookkeeping collaborative through its powerful online platform. It will weave together all the version control from your local computer with other collaborators you work with.\nIt is used for code and files: organize, archive, bookkeeping, searchable, changes visualized, etc. In the figure below, notice the familiar red and green to denote deletions and additions line-by-line, with darker shading to identify specific text within a line. Also notice the differencing in the image’s color bar!\n\n \nWe aren’t going to teach traditional git/GitHub today, but here are some recommendations if you’d like to learn. First, read Jenny Bryan’s “Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?” (open-access pre-print from PeerJ, published in The American Statistican). This provides an excellent overview. One quote I like in particular is\n\nCollaboration is the most compelling reason to manage a project with Git and GitHub. My definition of collaboration includes hands-on participation by multiple people, including your past and future self, as well as an asymmetric model, in which some people are active makers and others only read or review. - Jenny Bryan, “Excuse Me, Do You Have a Moment to Talk About Version Control?”\n\nNext, to learn GitHub with R, the absolute best resource is Jenny Bryan’s Happy Git With R. This is a comprehensive, friendly step-by-step process of how to do so, and is an awesome reference for seasoned git/GitHub users as well. If you want a shorter-form resource, I’d recommend 2 tutorials from OHI-Science’s data-science-training. This also teaches you how to set up GitHub to sync directly through RStudio, so that you don’t have to have any other software (including the command line) open to do so:\n\nGitHub\nCollaborating with GitHub\n\nOn my local computer, I interact with GitHub through RStudio 99.9% of the time (use command line .1% of time). Upcoming: resources for setting up GitHub without RStudio"

It is really powerful to have collaborative “todo”’s in the same software (and user accounts) as all the analysis and all the people that you’re already working with.\nWe will talk about “Issues” & “Projects” in the next chapter."

    "text": "GitHub framework in a nutshell\n\nUsers vs. organizations\nExample: jules32 is a user account, openscapes is an organization group.\nYou can think of them like other social media accounts: I can be an individual or part of a group, and there are permissions associated with both.\n\n\nRepositories (“repos”)\nRepos are GitHub’s main unit. They are essentially a folder, and you’ll put files and folders in them. They are contained, with permissions specific to each one.\nIt makes it easier to navigate through and find stuff — so you are “not sifting through a zoo of files” as one Openscapes Champion has said.\n\n\n“Commits” & “commit messages”\nUnlike Dropbox or Google Drive that constantly and automatically sync to the cloud, you have to deliberately tell git/GitHub when you have an amount of work that you want to be versioned and synced. You have to commit to telling them. GitHub takes care of the backend bookkeeping involved, but you have to write a human-readable message to your future self and others. That is the commit message.\nThere is no absolute guidance for how often to commit, but I think of it as leaving breadcrumbs for yourself. How much work and on what things/in what combination would you like to be able to reverse? What kind of information will make it easier for Future You to work with?\n\n\nPublic vs private\nYou can have both public (the free default) and private repositories, and change these permissions later on. I mostly work in public repos, but if I work in private ones, I often have the expectation that they will be made public some day. So I practice good habits with commits and documentation, and keep conversations on-topic.\n\n\nThe search feature is awesome\nYou are able to search within a GitHub repository, across repositories in an organization, or across all GitHub public repositories. I find this helps me find things quickly if I’m looking for how I’ve used a function in the past, or if I remember a word that would stand out that I included in a commit message as a breadcrumb to myself. It will also search Issues within the repositories, so you can look for specific words in conversations as well.\n\n\nBranches & Forks\nWe’re not going to talk about branches and forks. These are a core feature of what makes GitHub super powerful for software development, and one of the first things you’ll see in GitHub tutorials geared towards software engineers. But I do not think that is the most relevant or smoothest entryway for those of us who are scientists fairly new to collaborative coding and version control."
