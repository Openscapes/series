Work culture exists whether or not you talk about it or write it down.

Corey Clatterbuck and Anna Holder, co-leads of Openscapes Champions Cohorts at the California Water Boards / CalEPA created this lesson on Documentation. Corey brought a new perspective to documentation starting with "why document and what to document" and Anna Holder introduced thinking about your Pathway.
