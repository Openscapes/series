This is a brief (incomplete) introduction to the idea of open communities. We will explore: What are open communities? Why engage with them? How to engage with them? And also how Twitter as a legit tool for coding and science. Originally focusing on R communities, we are adding more examples beyond.\n\n**Slides** that have been presented during Champions Program Cohort Calls:\n\n-   [Open Communities](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17HSNmBYvPw-7Prioys7WIhL9QGVb3s3bJCLaAJVaChc/edit?usp=sharing), which we go through in a Cohort Call\n-   [Discovering Community Tools](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1czvMz7a84jkaYDwHlG1cuKyf9B0mciQJVOFcc7hZtpU/edit?usp=sharing), which teams review during a Seaside Chat\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOpen communities are groups of people openly creating, sharing, teaching, collaborating. They are united around a shared interest: coding language, topic, discipline, etc.\n\nThey have a culture of shared & continued learning, prioritize diversity, equity, inclusion.\n\nThey have online and in-person activities.\n\nHere are some examples of communities.

Formally incentivize and teach! Include in promotion/tenure (we shouldn't really have to teach ourselves on our own time and not be credited), create jobs\n-   Carry on & forward your experience from Openscapes\n\n## How to get started?\n\nGoogle your interests/needs. When you Google, include what you want to do PLUS r, rstats; python.\n\nStart by listening and learning. Be deliberate: curate who you follow.\n\nLike and share when you're comfortable.\n\nThen, contribute -- your ideas, your blogs, your papers, your code... Contributors are welcome in open communities! And know too that the R packages ggplot & knitr were created by students (Wickham & Xie) (see [McBain 2019](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/our-colour-of-magic-the-open-sourcery-of-fantastic-r-packages)).\n\nFinally, Twitter is a legit tool for science. It's a good way to learn what you need to learn and broadening your horizons while building community. Some places to start: `#rstats, #rstatsES, #rspatial, #pydata, #BlackAndSTEM, #MeTooSTEM`\n\n[Seaside Chats](https://github.com/Openscapes/seaside-chats#seaside-chats) are a great way to start exploring together.\n\n## Examples in the wild: campus coding clubs\n\n-   [EcoDataScience](http://eco-data-science.github.io/) at UC Santa Barbara\n-   [BioData Club](https://biodata-club.github.io) at OHSU\n-   [The Bio-Data Club](https://www.biodataclub.org/) at Moffitt\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["include-files.lua","quarto"],"toc":true,"output-file":"communities.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"0.9.626","theme":{"light":["cosmo","theme.scss"],"dark":["cosmo","theme-dark.scss"]},"mainfont":"Atkinson Hyperlegible","code-copy":true,"title":"Open communities"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
