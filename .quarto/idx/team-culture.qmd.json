There is a lot of work to do to improve research culture, and we can lead by example in our own research groups and communities.\n\n**Slides** that have been presented during Champions Program Cohort Calls: \n\n- [Team culture](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QlzV7wjP20GoLwpwUmEfBb_y4AuZnJgU_foI564FhXo/edit?usp=sharing)\n- [Psychological safety](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TwCyf9xicLWBfPhW9HnYQH3-mHycEyVKTm38zSg4D3Q/edit?usp=sharing), contributed by [Tara Robertson](https://tararobertson.ca/)\n\nSee also the following chapter on [Codes of Conduct](additional-lessons/code-of-conduct.qmd).\n\n\n<!---https://twitter.com/Napaaqtuk/status/1528790732718452738 --->\n\n---\n\n<!--- \nTO Add\n\nJ.

Edmondson is the Novartis Professor of Leadership and Management at Harvard Business School. \n\na shared belief that team members will not be rejected or embarrassed for speaking up with their ideas, questions, or concerns\n\nhttps://hbr.org/2022/03/research-to-excel-diverse-teams-need-psychological-safety\n\nThey recommend three ways to build psychologically safe environments: framing, inquiry, and bridging boundaries.\n\nFrame meetings as opportunities for information-sharing. \nFrame differences as a source of value. \n\nOpen questions. \nQuestions that build shared ownership and causality. \n\nListening - \n\n    Hopes and goals. What do you want to accomplish?\n    Resources and skills. What do you bring to the table?\n    Concerns and obstacles. What are you up against? What are you worried about?\n\n\n### Science benefits from diversity\n\nAnd we need to be deliberate about welcoming and including people from diverse backgrounds.  \n\nA few recent articles from Nature with many more links within: \n\n- [Science benefits from diversity](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05326-3)\n- [What does it take to make an institution more diverse?](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05317-4)\n\n### Sexual harassment is rife in the sciences \n\n[Sexual harassment is rife in the sciences, finds landmark US study](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05404-6). *Existing policies to address the issue are ineffective, concludes a long-awaited report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.*\n\nMost common form is gender harassment: it's the “put-downs as opposed to come-ons”.\n\n### We need to unlearn racism and build antiracist culture in science\n\n- [Ten simple rules for building an antiracist lab](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008210) - Chaudhary & Berhe, 2020.

This set the tone of the whole conference to be the most positive I have ever attended.\n\n### Collegiality\n\nWe must deliberately set the tone for collegiality to create a positive, inclusive research group environment.\n\nSafety and accessibility as parts of inclusion and empowerment. Does everyone feel safe to speak up? Does everyone have channels to contribute? This is especially true as the tech we use evolves. Who can participate?\n\nThis builds resilience to your research group. If someone needs to leave for a family emergency, maternity/paternity leave, vacation, set yourselves up so your team continue smoothly/ — Angela Bassa RStudio talk\n\nOpportunity cost of not doing this. Burnout, people leaving science. \n\n<!--- Panel: hp: in academia there is only one thing, and it's being smart --->\n\n### Team efficiency \n\nWe must deliberately set the tone to create a positive, inclusive research group environment that fuels team efficiency.\n\nThis means create a team mindset, and focusing on similarities rather differences. We all work on different projects and have different research questions, but we all have to wrangle data, organize version files, have things we don't know...let's create a space where we can talk about all this and find common ground to tackle together so we don't reinvent.\n\nThere can be an advantage to having team conventions. This can both reduce friction and reinventing the wheel. But there also needs to be room for different skills people come in with.  For example, if they’re more efficient in Python, don’t want to force R. But want to create space where folks can interoperate and work together. The tech/software side helps with this, but it's our mindsets too. We need to be open to it.\n\n## Open software can facilitate open/shared culture \n\nA lot to say here, for now, see:\n\n- <https://openscapes.github.io/slides/betterscience/environment-canada>\n- <https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/open-software-means-kinder-science/>\n\n## Enabling & participating\n\nHere are some ideas that you can support and participate in to learn and create a kinder team culture: \n\n### Seaside chats – discuss share data workflows\n\nFrom Michelle Stuart's [blog about the Pinsky Lab's first Fishbowl chat](http://pinsky.marine.rutgers.edu/fishbowl-chat-1/): \n\n> This open communication has leaked into the general discussion going on  in our open work space. Lab members seem more comfortable with asking  teammates for help, and it is exciting to see all of us getting on the same page with our data science.\"�\n\n### Hackathons or documentation parties – co-create\n\n### Social events \n\nGet to know each other outside of work. Do some during work hours can include more people who can't participate after work\n\n### Onboarding – how to welcome new people to your research group\n\n### Asking for help\n\nCreate a welcoming environment where they know where to ask for help – They won't know what questions to ask. Provide structure. \n\n### Code of Conduct (next chapter)!\n\n<!--- \nFurther reading\nhttps://laderast.github.io/psych_safety/#18\n--->\n\n## Further Resources\n\n- [A Practical Guide to Mentoring Across Intersections](https://conversations.vanguardstem.com/a-practical-guide-to-mentoring-across-intersections-c596496ee334) - Harriot 2020 *VanguardSTEM Blog*\n- [Get it wrong for me: What I need from allies](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/get-wrong-me-what-i-need-from-allies-megan-carpenter/?trackingId=XxaMtahqr9ZJfAGcCptmFQ%3D%3D) - Carpenter  2020. \n  - \"Now, when someone asks, ‘what do you need from me’, I say, ‘I need you to learn, I need you to care’. Somehow, we’ve all evolved to underestimate the power of learning and the power of seeking to understand. Knowing what things harm me is a sign that you value me. ...Then I want an ally who works to change their individual behavior and change the system around us for the better. Not just one or the other. I want a bunch of people who are interested in becoming allies to me to get it wrong. Because I promise, you will get it wrong, likely more than once. But please get it wrong, for me. Be wrong on my behalf. Try stuff, learn stuff, make attempts, and fail. Embrace the discomfort of not knowing, of not being certain, of not understanding and then be motivated enough to learn and get better. I will give you grace if you give me effort.
