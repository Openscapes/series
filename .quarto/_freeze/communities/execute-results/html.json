This is a brief (incomplete) introduction to the idea of open communities. We will explore: What are open communities? Why engage with them? How to engage with them? And also how Twitter as a legit tool for coding and science. Originally focusing on R communities, we are adding more examples beyond.\n\n**Slides** that have been presented during Champions Program Cohort Calls:\n\n-   [Open Communities](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17HSNmBYvPw-7Prioys7WIhL9QGVb3s3bJCLaAJVaChc/edit?usp=sharing), which we go through in a Cohort Call\n-   [Discovering Community Tools](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1czvMz7a84jkaYDwHlG1cuKyf9B0mciQJVOFcc7hZtpU/edit?usp=sharing), which teams review during a Seaside Chat\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n## What are open communities?\n\nOpen communities are groups of people openly creating, sharing, teaching, collaborating. They are united around a shared interest: coding language, topic, discipline, etc.\n\nThey have a culture of shared & continued learning, prioritize diversity, equity, inclusion.\n\nThey have online and in-person activities.\n\nHere are some examples of communities. Read more & direct links: <https://rstudio-conf-2020.github.io/r-for-excel/collaborating.html#r-communities>\n\n<center>\n\n<img src=\"img/rstats-communities.png\" width=\"600px\"/></a>\n\n<figcaption>\n\nSome #rstats communities with in-person and online events and channels\n\n</figcaption>\n\n</center>\n\n<br>\n\nThere are strategies for learning with both online and local communities.\n\n## Why engage with open communities?\n\n-   Skillshare (teach & learn)\n    -   Coding, software, workflows\n    -   Collaboration, leadership, DEIJ\n-   Meet allies, grow friendships, career opportunities\n-   Help improve science & scientific culture\n    -   Increase visibility & value of coding, data, collaboration skills\n    -   Drive change: modern ways to contribute to science. Formally incentivize and teach! Include in promotion/tenure (we shouldn't really have to teach ourselves on our own time and not be credited), create jobs\n-   Carry on & forward your experience from Openscapes\n\n## How to get started?\n\nGoogle your interests/needs. When you Google, include what you want to do PLUS r, rstats; python.\n\nStart by listening and learning. Be deliberate: curate who you follow.\n\nLike and share when you're comfortable.\n\nThen, contribute -- your ideas, your blogs, your papers, your code... Contributors are welcome in open communities! And know too that the R packages ggplot & knitr were created by students (Wickham & Xie) (see [McBain 2019](https://resources.rstudio.com/rstudio-conf-2019/our-colour-of-magic-the-open-sourcery-of-fantastic-r-packages)).\n\nFinally, Twitter is a legit tool for science. It's a good way to learn what you need to learn and broadening your horizons while building community. Some places to start: `#rstats, #rstatsES, #rspatial, #pydata, #BlackAndSTEM, #MeTooSTEM`\n\n[Seaside Chats](https://github.com/Openscapes/seaside-chats#seaside-chats) are a great way to start exploring together.\n\n## Examples in the wild: campus coding clubs\n\n-   [EcoDataScience](http://eco-data-science.github.io/) at UC Santa Barbara\n-   [BioData Club](https://biodata-club.github.io) at OHSU\n-   [The Bio-Data Club](https://www.biodataclub.org/) at Moffitt",
