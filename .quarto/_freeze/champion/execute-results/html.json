Data science is a discipline that can improve your analyses**\n\n- There are concepts, theory, and tools for thinking about and working with data. \n- Your study system is not unique when it comes to data, and accepting this will speed up your analyses.\n\n*This helps your science:*\n\n- Think deliberately about data: when you distinguish data questions from research questions, you'll learn how and who to ask for help\n- Save heartache: you don’t have to reinvent the wheel\n- Save time: when you expect there’s a better way to do what you are doing, you'll find the solution faster. Focus on the science.\n\n\n**2. Open data science tools exist**\n\n- Data science tools that enable open science are game-changing for analysis, collaboration and communication.\n- Open science is \"the concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers\" ([Hampton et al. 2015](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/ES14-00402.1/abstract)))  \n\n*This helps your science:*\n\n- Have confidence in your analyses from this traceable, reusable record\n- Save time through automation, thinking ahead of your immediate task, reduced bookkeeping, and collaboration\n- Take advantage of convenient access: working openly online is like having an extended memory\n\n**3. Learn these tools with collaborators and community (redefined):** \n\n- Your most important collaborator is Future You. \n- Community should also be beyond the colleagues in your field.\n- Learn from, with, and for others. \n\n*This helps your science:* \n\n- If you learn to talk about your data, you'll find solutions faster. \n- Build confidence: these skills are transferable beyond your science.\n- Be empathetic and inclusive and build a network of allies \n\n## Build community\n\nJoin existing communities locally and online, and start local chapters with friends!\n\nSome ideas: \n\n- [Mozilla Study Groups](https://science.mozilla.org/programs/studygroups) Example: [Eco-data-science](http://eco-data-science.github.io/). Also see ([Steven et al. 2018](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/02/15/265421)) \n- [RLadies](https://rladies.org/). Example: [RLadies Santa Barbara](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/)\n\nThese meetups can be for skill-sharing, showcasing how people work, or building community so you can troubleshoot together. They can be an informal \"hacky hour\" at a cafe or pub!\n\n<!---\n## Other lessons\n\n### Naming files\n\nNow is a good interlude to talk about naming things. \n\nWe are going to take five minutes to talk through [Jenny Bryan's three principles for naming files](https://speakerdeck.com/jennybc/how-to-name-files):\n\n1. machine readable\n1. human readable\n1. play well with default ordering\n--->",
