There are growing examples of better science in less time in environmental and Earth science, and beyond. Here are a few examples to showcase what is possible and being done by the community.\n\n**Slides** that have been presented during Champions Program Cohort Calls: \n\n- [Better science in less time](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GmuTa1sUO_boH-2TonC875pD5xvXaIMHRKIoO3vUrdY/edit?usp=sharing)\n- [Empowering transformational science](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SUMiQg0HhD19H-D6DDzTrFQVzub0kOINwJBG59uQCTw/edit#slide=id.p1) - [Dr. Chelle Gentemann](https://twitter.com/ChelleGentemann)\n\nHere we also introduce the [**Pathway document**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X_-qPdWDCpw2F3nZr6vZnq87guyUIGLvekm0XV2H-A8) that teams will develop throughout the Champions program. The Pathway is based on Table 1 in Lowndes et al. 2017, and helps teams deliberately identify data workflow practices and next steps to facilitate efficiency and open culture in terms of reproduciblity, collaboration, communication, and culture. \n\n---\n\n## Ocean Health Index: behind the scenes\n\nSome key points to discuss from [Lowndes *et al. 2017, Nature Ecology & Evolution*: Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160): \n\n- Reproducibility & communication enabled by open tooling\n- Shared practices are useful beyond shared projects\n\nIf you're interested in more overview of the OHI setup, see this 2017 talk (25 mins): [OHI Better science in less time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4uzVAZvFCA)\n\n### OHI pathway \n\n- Motivated by necessity\n- Reimagined by possibility and community \n- Done incrementally!\n- Yes: it’s an investment. \n- Also yes: huge, enduring payoff for (your) science\n\n### Reproducibility & communication enabled by open tooling\n\nRMarkdown to reimagine data analysis and communication. RMarkdown combines analyses & figures together, rendered to your reporting output of choice. \n\nAn example: <http://ohi-science.org/betterscienceinlesstime/>\n\n- Website built with R/RMarkdown & Github  \n- You can get started too: ([1-hour tutorial](https://jules32.github.io/rmarkdown-website-tutorial/)) \n\n### Shared workflows not only useful for shared projects\n\n- OHI team: we identified as a team & prioritized helping each other\n  - We work on many different projects\n  - Use same workflows, share feedback, can think together across projects\n- Shared conventions reduce friction & cognitive load\n  - Common ground, easier to talk about, easier to ask for help\n  - You don’t need to design everything from scratch\n\nAnd, critically: \n\n- It’s about increasing efficiency and reproducibility and open science. \n- But it is also about increasing participation and inclusion. \n- Consider diversity, equity, and inclusion in your daily practices.\n- How you work and onboard others to your projects is a DEI issue. \n\n## Examples in the wild: environmental science\n\n- [Regime Shifts in R & Data Science within the BC Public Service Observations from the field](https://stephhazlitt.github.io/regime-shifts/slides#1) - Stephanie Hazlitt, Government of British Columbia, slides from CascadiaRconf keynote\n- [NMFSReports: Easily write NOAA reports and tech memos in R Markdown!](https://github.com/EmilyMarkowitz-NOAA/NMFSReports/blob/main/presentations/2021-06-05%20NMFSReports%20-%20R%20Cascadia%20Conf.pdf) - Emily Markowitz, NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center, slides from CascadiaRconf talk\n- [Automated reporting in Tampa Bay with open science](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2020/11/16/tampa-bay-reporting/) - Marcus Beck, Tampa Bay Estuary Program, Openscapes blog \n  - [TBEP's Data Management Workflow](https://tbep-tech.github.io/data-management-sop/workflow.html) and open science cake\n\n## Further resources\n\n### Not so standard deviation podcast \n\nParker & Peng  \n<http://nssdeviations.com>  \nGreat discussions about data concepts and “in the wild”  \n[Episode 9: Spreadsheet drama](http://nssdeviations.com/episode-9-spreadsheet-drama)\n\n### Practical computing for biologists \n\nHaddock & Dunn  \n<http://practicalcomputing.org/>  \nSoftware & computing concepts already on your computer  \nChapter 2: Regular expressions  \n\n\n<!---\n\nBroman, K.
