# Welcome {#welcome}

Hello! This book is the lesson series for the [**Openscapes Champions program**](https://www.openscapes.org/champions/), an open data science mentorship program for science teams. 

Openscapes Champions is a professional development and leadership opportunity for teams to reimagine data analysis & stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to them, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities. Cohorts are ~7 research teams (~35 total participants including team leads and members) that convene remotely to explore open data science tooling and practices together. This is a remote-by-design program since its launch in 2019.

This open curriculum is improved iteratively and the most recent version always available online. Chapters accompany slide decks that are taught through [Cohort Agendas](#agendas) (below), depending on the Cohort duration. The lesson series is originally framed around "Our path to better science in less time using open data science tools" [(Lowndes et al. 2017)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0160). <!--- That paper is a retrospective of how a team's data workflow changed over four years; Openscapes Champions aims to help guide other teams to accelerate this timeline and begin make similar progress themselves, no matter where they are starting from. ---> As we learn and iterate with Cohorts of different durations and from different disciplines, the curriculum will iterate and grow as well.

**Openscapes Champions** is a professional development and leadership opportunity for research teams to explore open data science practices. It is a remote-by-design mentorship program that guides teams through the open data science landscape, empowers them as leaders, and welcomes them as part of the growing open community. Participants attend as a team with their research group — including the team lead — in a cohort with other teams, together learning how to reframe data-intensive science as a collaborative effort rather than an individual burden. A driving motivation is to reduce the burden for early career faculty/leads wanting to modernize their research groups' approaches to collaborative data analysis and stewardship. By discussing open software tooling and communities enabling reproducible research (e.g. R/RStudio, GitHub, metadata), research groups develop collaborative skills, mindsets, and habits and establish shared practices for increased efficiency in their own research, while contributing to a more inclusive scientific culture. Openscapes’ mentorship and community engagement approaches center on open data science as kinder science, enabling increased efficiency and resilience for teams so that their work has more enduring impact.

## Cohort Agendas

Research teams participate as a cohort over several months, meeting twice-monthly for 1.5-hour sessions we call Cohort Calls. Cohort Calls are designed to be engaging, requiring discussion and active participation through shared live notetaking in Google Docs and video as a group and breakout groups. 

Cohort Call agendas and slides are all openly available in a [Google Folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HQHXlMVgg9lp2IYkzj8LSAG5bjyKFS6g), and identified individually in the following tables. As we continue to learn and iterate from working with different research groups, you can always review the [agenda archive](https://github.com/Openscapes/series/blob/master/agenda-archive.md) for specific cohorts. Additionally, we end each lesson by learning hands-on efficiency tips, compiled here as an [Efficiency Tips Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSABwrk4RgOa2XBv0ZVmQCEYtLmT-YOm7WHL0ba0eREcJ5G-uk4abqznKEX0YabHux48uVGxxAZXeJ4/pub) and [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQqWV6qFUv6WOztKqj52gUfvVlYc5Emw6Z-YzoM5fr9uOHRDLTDC625pdKVe5PwhlRmZlklNB7Lulq4/pubhtml).

Between Cohort Calls, each team meets together for a [Seaside Chat](https://www.openscapes.org/blog/2019/03/10/seaside-chats/) to begin identifying and addressing shared needs; Seaside Chats have been described by participants as one of the most valuable parts of the Champions Program. Additionally, we coordinate skill-building Clinics and Co-Working sessions (which differ from "Office Hours" because participants come to work and learn together) between Cohort Calls.

### Two-month

The two-month Champions program includes 4 Cohort Calls and 1 GitHub Clinic. The core lesson series focuses on building an open science mindset, building efficiency and open culture within the team, and building sustained learning practices with broader communities. At the end of the program, each team describes their trailhead and pathways forward.

### Four-month

The four-month Champions program includes 8 Cohort Calls and 2 Clinics. Beginning with the core lessons from the two-month program, we work with partners to co-develop new curriculum specific to a community.

## About

The Series is written (and always improving) to be used as a reference, to teach, or as self-paced learning. And also, awesomely, it's created with the same tools and practices we will be talking about: R and RStudio — specifially [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/) — and GitHub.

[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org) is co-directed by Julia Stewart Lowndes and Erin Robinson. It is operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis ([NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/)) and was incubated by a [Mozilla](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/) Fellowship awarded to Lowndes in 2018.
