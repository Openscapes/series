Start off here: https://github.com/rladies/starter-kit/wiki, and get started on the first 2 points. They'll help you set up accounts for GitHub, Twitter, Slack, and Meetup, and then you can start thinking about getting together for the first time. Do you have another RLady to help or at least chat with about it?
