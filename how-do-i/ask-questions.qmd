Where do I go when I need to get unblocked? Where do I go when I want to learn how to unblock myself? Here are some resources. Most examples are with R, but the principles of how and where to ask questions apply broadly.

## How to get help in R

[How to get help in R](https://ellakaye.rbind.io/talks/2020-10-29_how-to-get-help-in-r/), a presentation for R-Ladies Coventry, by Ella Kaye, 2021. 

> In the session, Ella will talk us through different ways to get help when you get stuck on a problem in R. We’ll cover how and where to look for answers and how to ask and post good questions that make it easy for others to help you, including a demo of the excellent [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) and [datapasta](https://milesmcbain.github.io/datapasta/) packages. So whether you’re an R novice or more experienced R user, hopefully there’ll be some useful tips for you!
